      <title>Background</title>
      <p id="Par21">Thousands of mutations have been implicated in promoting neurodevelopmental disorders, with different degrees of certainty and a myriad of phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An understanding of the consequences of specific gene mutations will be crucial to identifying common pathways and potential therapies for these disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, memory performance involving working and spatial memory is severely reduced in ASD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. ASD can be driven by mutations that cause changes in brain wiring, structure, and function. Mutations in more than 1300 genes&#x2014;including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy-number variations (CNVs), deletions, and duplications&#x2014;are associated with ASD, reflecting the complexity of its multifactorial genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In particular, mutations that affect the function, loading, or availability of synaptic vesicles have been strongly associated with the manifestation of ASD-like phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For instance, mice carrying mutations in Syn1, a synaptic vesicle component, cause limited synaptic vesicle release and, in Nhe9, a Na&#x2009;+&#x2009;/H&#x2009;+&#x2009;exchanger, cause hyper-acidification of vesicles; both mice mutants show phenotypes associated with ASD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par22">The evolutionarily conserved VPS50 protein functions in synaptic and dense-core vesicle maturation and acidification both in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and in murine cultured neurons and controls behavioral state in <italic>C. elegans;</italic> VPS50 is widely expressed in both the <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the murine nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. VPS50 is associated with components of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex and more specifically with the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex, suggesting a role in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles by early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> VPS50 physically interacts with the protein VHA-15, a component of the V-ATPase complex pump responsible for acidifying both dense core and synaptic vesicles, and knockdown of VPS50 in cultured murine neurons causes a robust decrease in synaptic vesicle acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In humans, a deletion spanning the <italic>Vps50</italic> gene, and the calcitonin receptor, has been reported in an ASD patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. More recently, two patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder including severe developmental delays and intellectual disability were reported to carry homozygous loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Vps50</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These findings implicate VPS50 in ASD. However, no mechanisms have been identified that link the phenotypes shown by these patients to their deficits in <italic>Vps50</italic> function.</p>
      <p id="Par23">Below we describe our use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to produce VPS50 knockouts (KO) in cultured murine neurons and mosaic knockouts (mKOs) in living mice, allowing us to analyze the role of VPS50 in synaptic function and mouse behavior. Our findings suggest mechanisms through which VPS50 mutations contribute to ASD phenotypes in general and to cognitive impairment in particular. In addition, our brain mosaic VPS50 mKO animal model should enable further investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the function of VPS50 and its relationship to ASD.</p>

        <title>VPS50 modulates synaptic vesicle acidification and V-ATPase V1 domain pump localization in cortical neurons</title>
        <p id="Par24">In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, VPS50 KO causes changes in behavior state, likely as a consequence of defects in synaptic and dense core vesicle acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In mice, VPS50 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, and its knock-down in culture causes dysregulation of synaptic vesicle acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To further investigate the role of VPS50 in regulating mammalian synaptic function and behavior, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate VPS50 KO murine neurons. Cortical neuron cultures from Cas9 KI mice were transduced at 3 DIV with AAV encoding tdTomato as an infection marker alone or together with sgRNAs targeting the <italic>Vps50</italic> gene. The transduction efficiency reached&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;90% of cultured neurons. Genomic DNA was extracted 10 days after infection, and a T7 endonuclease I assay was performed to determine the efficiency of gene editing. We tested different combinations of sgRNAs targeting the <italic>Vps50</italic> genomic locus and observed the highest editing efficiency when the pair sgRNA1 and sgRNA6 were used together (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A).</p>
        <p id="Par25">Next, we performed a series of experiments using together sgRNA1 and sgRNA6 (hereafter referred to as &#x201C;VPS50 KO&#x201D; in culture and &#x201C;VPS50 mKO&#x201D; in mice). T7 endonuclease I assay revealed that in cultured neurons VPS50 KO allows efficient gene editing (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Editing of the <italic>Vps50</italic> locus caused a&#x2009;~&#x2009;70% reduction in VPS50 mRNA and protein levels in cortical neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B&#x2013;D), confirming an efficient KO of VPS50 after gene editing. Locus-specific sequencing showed the resulting edited genomic sequences that were introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 as evidenced by the presence of deletions represented by dashes when compared to the WT sequence (Additional file 1: Fig. S1B). Since VPS50 has been related to synaptic vesicle acidification, we next evaluated if the number of vesicles was changed in VPS50 KO neurons. Importantly, VPS50 KO neurons showed no significant difference in the total number of synaptic vesicles as assessed by electron microscopy (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E, F). To determine changes in synaptic vesicle acidification, we used the ratio-SyPhy probe, which in red signal shows all synaptic vesicles and in green the vesicles with basic pH, we observed a robust reduction in vesicle acidification in VPS50 KO neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). Quantification using a Mander&#x2019;s coefficient to show the ratio of red clusters (vesicles) that are also green (high pH) shows a reduction in the coefficient (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>H), consistent with previous observations showing that VPS50 modulates synaptic vesicle acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#xA0;1</label><caption><p>VPS50 gene editing causes a decrease in synaptic vesicle acidification but no change in synaptic vesicle number.

        <p id="Par26">As VPS50 is enriched in synaptic and dense core vesicles and appears as a soluble protein in mouse brain extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we next performed proximity ligation assays (PLA) to evaluate its approximate location within the synapse. PLA assesses the proximity between two proteins of interest by generating a positive fluorescent signal. In this study, the positive signal is observed as puncta in the red channel (550 nm), indicating that the targeted proteins are within a distance of&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;40 nm. First, we tested in control neurons whether VPS50 was proximal to either the post-synaptic protein PSD95 or the presynaptic protein in synaptic vesicles Synapsin1. We observed the PLA signal only in proximity to Synapsin1, confirming that VPS50 is near or within synaptic vesicles (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). This interaction was quantified showing high PLA puncta only in the VPS50/Syn1 condition (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). As controls, we performed PLA reactions using Synapsin1/Synaptophysin and PSD95/Synaptophysin (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A-B). Since VPS50 interacts directly with ATP6V1H in murine tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and synaptic vesicle acidification is reduced in VPS50 KO neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G, H), it is possible that VPS50 facilitates the sorting or assembly of the V-ATPase complex in synaptic vesicles to acidify them for neurotransmitter filling. To test this possibility, we used PLA to evaluate the proximity of VPS50 and the V-ATPaseV1 domain of the pump in control neurons and observed PLA signal, indicating proximity between VPS50 and the V-ATPaseV1 domain (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C; top). Importantly, in VPS50 KO neurons, this PLA signal was absent, confirming the reduced expression of VPS50 and a consequent lack of interaction between VPS50 and the V-ATPaseV1 domain of the pump (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C; bottom). Quantification of the PLA signal between VPS50/v-ATPaseV1 shows a significant decrease in the number of puncta per field in VPS50 KO neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). We then asked if the localization of the V-ATPaseV1 domain is disrupted in VPS50 KO neurons. While PLA experiments examining the V-ATPaseV1 domain and Synaptophysin showed that they are in proximity in control neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E; top), no corresponding signal was observed in VPS50 KO neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E; bottom), strongly suggesting that KO of VPS50 causes a mislocalization of the V-ATPaseV1 domain. Quantification of PLA signal between v-ATPaseV1/Syn shows a significant decrease in VPS50 KO neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F). As a control to show that there are no changes in the expression of the interacting proteins, in all PLA experiments, we imaged in the blue channel (633&#xA0;nm) the proteins of interest that were used to test interaction (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As an additional control for PLA experiments, we carried out western blot analyses of PSD95 and Synaptophysin in VPS50 KO neurons. As expected, we found a small reduction in PSD95 expression and no change in Synaptophysin expression levels (Additional file 1: Fig. S2I). Together, these results indicate that KO of VPS50 does not affect the total number of synaptic vesicles but produces a mislocalization of the V-ATPaseV1 domain that could in turn prevent the correct assembly of the v-ATPase complex and as a consequence could be likely responsible for the observed impairment in synaptic vesicle acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G, H).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#xA0;2</label><caption><p>VPS50 KO causes mislocalization of v-ATPaseV1 domain in cortical neurons. Proximity-ligation assays (PLAs) was used to determine proximity between studied proteins as indicated in each case. A positive PLA signal, thus proximity between the proteins, is observed as red puncta in images (red channel, 546 nm). In all experiments, an antibody against the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) was used to stain processes of all neurons (green channel, 488 nm). Merge shows superimposed images of MAP2 (green), PLA signals (red), and the signal for a protein of interest as shown in the figure (blue, 633 nm). <bold>A</bold> PLA using PSD95 or Synapsin1 (Syn1) antibodies to define pre- or post-synaptic localization of VPS50 in control neurons. <bold>B</bold> Quantification of PLA puncta per field of VPS50/PSD95 and VPS50/Syn1. <bold>C</bold> PLA to assess proximity of VPS50 and v-ATPAseV1 domain in control and VPS50 KO neurons. <bold>D</bold> Quantification of PLA puncta per field of VPS50/v-ATPaseV1 in control and VPS50 KO neurons. <bold>E</bold> PLA to determine proximity of v-ATPaseV1 domain and Synaptophysin (Syn) in control and VPS50 KO neurons. <bold>F</bold> Quantification of PLA puncta per field of v-ATPaseV1 domain/Syn in Control and VPS50 KO neurons.

Compared to control neurons, VPS50 KO neurons showed a strong reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of sEPCS (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A&#x2013;C). To determine if the amplitude and frequency of sEPSC decreased with time, we performed continuous sEPSC recordings for 30&#xA0;min. While in control neurons we observed no significant changes, VPS50 KO neurons displayed a significant reduction in the amplitude of the sEPSCs over time (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A-C), consistent with the idea that vesicular content might be reduced in VPS50 KO neurons. Moreover, VPS50 KO neurons showed a drastic reduction in the frequency but not in the amplitude of mEPSCs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D&#x2013;F), an effect that could reflect an increase in the exocytosis of empty vesicles. This reduction in synaptic strength correlates with a decrease in neuronal activity, as the spontaneous spike frequency was decreased in VPS50 KO neurons compared to control neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>G, H). In addition, calcium imaging using the genetically encoded GCaMP7 probe showed that VPS50 KO neurons were reduced in calcium event frequency, confirming deficient spiking (Additional file 1: Fig. S3D-E). To further evaluate if synaptic vesicle acidification was partly responsible for the reduction in vesicle content and neuronal activity, we used pHoenix, a genetically encoded proton pump targeted to synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Spontaneous spiking of pHoenix-infected control and VPS50 KO neurons was recorded for 1&#xA0;min as baseline, and then, 532&#xA0;nm light was used to activate pHoenix (yellow line under traces). During the 2-min activation period, we observed a partial recovery of spiking in VPS50 KO neurons close to control levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>I, J; yellow line). Moreover, after stimulation, we observed no significant differences from control neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>K). Altogether, our results strongly indicate that the reduction in synaptic activity in VPS50 KO requires synaptic vesicle acidification, since this reduction can be rescued by artificially acidifying synaptic vesicles.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#xA0;3</label><caption><p>VPS50 KO neurons show a reduction in synaptic activity that can be recovered by inducing synaptic vesicle acidification.

        <title>VPS50 mKO impacts synaptic function and memory formation</title>
        <p id="Par28">Having demonstrated that VPS50 KO causes a deficit in vesicle acidification as shown by Ratio-SyPhy (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G, H), and synaptic function in cultured cortical neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), we next aimed to evaluate whether VPS50 mKO in mice can cause changes in synaptic transmission and behavior in vivo, as observed previously for <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and as suggested for humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Toward this end, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to induce VPS50 mKO in the intact mouse brain. We delivered high titer AAVs at postnatal day 1 (P1) intracerebroventricularly to Cas9 KI mice. Animals were injected with the same sgRNAs tested previously in culture together with tdTomato as a fluorescence marker under the control of the human synapsin1 promoter; tdTomato alone was used as control. Post-mortem analyses showed high AAV infection in multiples brain areas (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, B), including the cortex and the hippocampus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). In those brain areas, VPS50 protein expression was significantly reduced&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;70% (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D&#x2013;F), confirming efficient mKO of VPS50 after gene editing in the mouse brain. In addition, the expression of VPS50 mRNA was also significantly reduced in VPS50 mKO animals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>G, H). No changes were observed in the brain length of VPS50 mKO mice; however, a significant difference in brain weight was found compared to the control group (Additional file 1: Fig. S4A-D). We then monitored basal synaptic function at Schaffer collateral-to-CA1 synapses in acute hippocampal slices. We observed a significant decrease in the frequency but not in the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in VPS50 mKO synapses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A&#x2013;C). Similarly, we observed a strong reduction in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) in VPS50 mKO synapses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D&#x2013;F). Moreover, input/output curves revealed a large decrease in the amplitudes of evoked EPSC at all stimulus intensities tested for VPS50 mKO synapses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, B). Importantly, paired-pulse facilitation remained unchanged (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C, D), suggesting that the decrease in evoked EPSC amplitude cannot be explained by changes in release probability, but rather could be a consequence of a decrease in vesicle content and/or vesicle refilling caused by a change in the level of acidification, as observed for cultured neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>G). To further evaluate whether the filling state of vesicles might be involved in this synaptic change, we used high-frequency stimulation to assess the response of VPS50 mKO synapses. High-frequency stimulation promotes full fusion of synaptic vesicles and posterior fast endocytosis for neurotransmitter filling. Thus, during high-frequency stimulation, a neuron with partial or null synaptic vesicle filling would be detected as a decrease in quantal size. Under this condition, the responses of VPS50 mKO to high-frequency stimulation synapses were greatly reduced compared to control synapses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E, F), strongly suggesting that vesicle content is reduced in VPS50 mKO synapses. Next, we investigated the impact of VPS50 mKO on hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity (LTP), the cellular mechanism underlying learning and memory. We found that the magnitude of LTP induced by high-frequency stimulation was reduced in mice with disrupted VPS50 compared to controls (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G, H), suggesting that there might be cognitive deficits in the context of memory formation in VPS50 mKO mice.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#xA0;4</label><caption><p>Systemic injection of AAV at P1 to produce VPS50 mKO. <bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> Representative image of coronal sections of a mouse brain (VPS50 mKO) injected at P1 with AAV after 15 weeks to show infection efficiency by tdTomato fluorescent signal.

        <p id="Par29">Finally, we evaluated the cognitive performance of VPS50 mKO mice in the Barnes maze and a fear-conditioning apparatus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), two memory formation paradigms dependent on the hippocampus. First, we asked if VPS50 mKO mice had locomotor problems that might affect their performance in behavioral testing. Accelerated rotarod test showed that VPS50 mKO animals spent more time on the ramp, evidencing better motor function than control animals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). In the Barnes maze (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B), VPS50 mKO animals made a significantly higher number of primary errors (holes checked before finding the escape hole) on days 1 and 2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C) but behaved similarly to control error numbers on days 3 and 4. Also, primary latency, the time the animal takes to find the escape hole, was significantly affected in VPS50 mKO, but only on the first day (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D), and VPS50 mKO animals spent significantly less time in the escape zone on days 1&#x2013;3 compared to control littermates (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E). These data indicate that VPS50 mKO animals have deficits in the short-term acquisition of spatial learning. Using the context-dependent fear-conditioning paradigm, we found that VPS50 mKO animals significantly decreased in freezing compared to control littermates (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F). Together, these results indicate that VPS50 mKO mice display alterations in hippocampal synaptic function and memory deficits dependent on this brain area.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#xA0;7</label><caption><p>VPS50 mKO animals show impaired hippocampal memory formation.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par30">The VPS50 protein is evolutionarily conserved, with homologs in <italic>C. elegans, M. musculus</italic>, and humans, reflecting its fundamental importance in cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. VPS50 has been associated with the EARP complex (endosome-associated recycling protein) and more specifically with dense core and synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Studies of <italic>C. elegan</italic>s revealed that VPS50 controls locomotion and behavioral state by controlling vesicle acidification and function, likely by regulating the assembly of the V-ATPase pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The V-ATPase pump is recruited to synaptic vesicles after recycling to facilitate neurotransmitter filling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants in the gene unc-32, which encodes the homolog of the human V-ATPase pump, have severe deficits in motoneuron neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, the V-ATPase pump acidifies cellular compartments broadly in the cell; specificity is conferred by the differential formation of the complex by different isoforms and protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par31">Our findings reveal a critical role of VPS50 in synaptic function and behavior in mammals and demonstrate that this role likely involves synaptic vesicle acidification. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to produce KO of VPS50 in cultured cortical neurons, we showed that VPS50 KO neurons exhibited mislocalization of the V-ATPaseV1 domain, lacking proximity to synaptic vesicles, without affecting the total number of synaptic vesicles. Instead, this mislocalization impedes the correct assembly of the v-ATPase complex affecting vesicle acidification, thereby influencing vesicular content and/or vesicle refilling. The limited acidification of synaptic vesicles is known to reduce neurotransmitter filling and cause a consequent decline in synaptic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our findings strongly indicate that VPS50 plays a crucial role in facilitating the proper sorting of the v-ATPaseV1 domain near synaptic vesicles or the assembly of the v-ATPase complex that permits synaptic vesicle acidification.</p>
      <p id="Par32">Our data further demonstrate that in cultured neurons the reduction of VPS50 impairs synaptic transmission and that these deficiencies can be recovered by artificially acidifying synaptic vesicles. Electrophysiological recordings using hippocampal slices showed a strong decrease in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events, a reduction of the amplitude after high-frequency stimulation, and a severe deficit in LTP formation. These observations strongly support the idea that the changes observed in synaptic activity were a consequence of the exocytosis of empty or partially filled synaptic vesicles, similar to what has been shown in cultured hippocampal neurons in which the v-ATPase pump had been pharmacologically blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These synaptic transmission defects likely caused the impaired memory formation of VPS50 mKO animals, linking the deficits in synaptic vesicle acidification and/or synaptic filling to complex cognitive behaviors such as learning and memory formation. Deficits in working and spatial memory have been described as one of the phenotypes of ASD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], a phenotype that has also been described for patients with VPS50 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par33">In summary, our data demonstrate that VPS50 modulates synaptic transmission by facilitating the recruitment of the V-ATPase pump to synaptic vesicles, thereby enabling vesicle acidification and modulating vesicle content. Deficits in this process, as exhibited by VPS50 mKO mice, result in cognitive impairment. Future studies of VPS50 mKO mice should provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavioral consequences of VPS50 mKO and provide insights into how mutations in the VPS50 gene can lead to ASD.</p>

Briefly, acute coronal hippocampal slices (400 mm thick) were prepared from control and VPS50 mKO mice at postnatal day (P) 30 to P45. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% in 0.8 L/min air flow) in an induction chamber for 3 min and decapitated. Brain slices were cut using a DKT vibratome in a solution containing the following: 215 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.6 mM NaH2PO4, 1mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 4 mM MgSO4, and 20 mM glucose.

Extracellular field potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded with a patch pipette filled with 1 mM NaCl and placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Multiclamp 700B Molecular Devices, USA) were made from CA1 pyramidal neurons voltage-clamped at&#x2009;&#x2212;&#x2009;60 mV using patch pipette electrodes (3&#x2013;4 M&#x3A9;) containing the following intracellular solution: 131 mM Cs-gluconate, 8 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 292 mmol/kg osmolality. fEPSPs and EPSCs were evoked by stimulating Schaffer collateral inputs with a monopolar electrode filled with ACSF and positioned&#x2009;~&#x2009;100&#x2013;150 &#x3BC;m away from the recording pipette. mEPSCs were recorded at 32&#x2009;&#xB1;&#x2009;1 &#xB0;C in the continuous presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 500 nM) to block action potential-dependent release, whereas sEPSCs were recorded in the absence of TTX. Short-term synaptic plasticity was induced by two pulses (100 ms interstimulus interval) to calculate a paired-pulse ratio (PPR) that was defined as the ratio of the slope or amplitude of the second fEPSP/EPSC to the slope or amplitude of the first fEPSP/EPSC, respectively. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by 4 trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz repeated four times, separated by 10 s. The magnitude of LTP was compared with baseline 30&#x2013;40 min after applying the stimulation protocol. Reagents were obtained from Sigma, Tocris, and Ascent Scientific; prepared in stock solutions (water or DMSO); and added to the ACSF as needed. Total DMSO in the ACSF was maintained at less than 0.01%. For the whole-cells experiments, series resistance (range, 8&#x2013;12 M&#x3A9;) was monitored throughout the experiment with a 5 mV, 80 ms voltage step, and cells that exhibited significant changes in series resistance (20%) were excluded from analysis. All recordings were elicited at 15&#x2013;20-s intervals, filtered at 2.4 kHz, and acquired at 10 kHz, using custom-made software written in Igor Pro 6.36 (WaveMetrics).
