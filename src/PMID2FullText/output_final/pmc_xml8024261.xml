        <p id="Par1">Bone formation represents a heritable trait regulated by many signals and complex mechanisms. Its abnormalities manifest themselves in various diseases, including sclerosing bone disorder (SBD). Exploration of genes that cause SBD has significantly improved our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate bone formation. Here, we discover a previously unknown type of SBD in four independent families caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function pathogenic variants in <italic>TMEM53</italic>, which encodes a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein. <italic>Tmem53</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice recapitulate the human skeletal phenotypes. Analyses of the molecular pathophysiology using the primary cells from the <italic>Tmem53</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and the <italic>TMEM53</italic> knock-out cell lines indicates that TMEM53 inhibits BMP signaling in osteoblast lineage cells by blocking cytoplasm-nucleus translocation of BMP2-activated Smad proteins. Pathogenic variants in the patients impair the TMEM53-mediated blocking effect, thus leading to overactivated BMP signaling that promotes bone formation and contributes to the SBD phenotype. Our results establish a previously unreported SBD entity (craniotubular dysplasia, Ikegawa type) and contribute to a better understanding of the regulation of BMP signaling and bone formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Sclerosing bone disorder (SBD) is a heterogeneous group of monogenic diseases characterized by increased bone density. More than 40 disease entities, including osteopetrosis, dysosteosclerosis, and sclerosteosis, fall into this category<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, which encompasses a broad phenotypic spectrum involving lethality, bone fracture risk, and complications. Identification of dozens of the causal genes for SBD over the past few decades has not only improved precise diagnosis and genetic counseling of the diseases but also continuously driven the research of molecular mechanisms of bone formation and regulation of the skeletal system and exploration of innovative therapies for bone density-related diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays important roles in bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and is related to several human skeletal dysplasias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Binding of BMP2/4 to their receptors initiates the signal transduction cascade by inducing phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/9, which can then form hetero-complexes with SMAD4 followed by translocation into the nucleus to upregulate osteogenesis-related genes. However, the mechanism by which nuclear translocation is regulated remains unclear.</p>
      <p id="Par5">In this study, we discover a previously unknown type of SBD and identify its causal gene, <italic>TMEM53</italic>, which encodes nuclear envelope transmembrane (NET) protein 53 (TMEM53, also known as NET4). TMEM53 is initially identified in a screen for nuclear envelope proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and then later confirmed to localize to the outer membrane of the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Its function remains unclear, particularly in bone formation. We show that TMEM53 acts as an inhibitor of BMP-SMAD signaling by preventing SMAD accumulation in the cell nucleus and that its deficiency enhances osteogenic differentiation by overactivating the BMP signaling pathway. Our findings establish a previously unreported SBD entity and demonstrate a regulatory mechanism in the BMP signaling pathway that impacts bone formation and development.</p>

        <title>Identification of <italic>TMEM53</italic> pathogenic variants in a previously unknown type of SBD</title>
        <p id="Par6">We recruited individuals with SBD from the Japanese Skeletal Dysplasia Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.riken.jp/lab/OA-team/JSDC/">http://www2.riken.jp/lab/OA-team/JSDC/</ext-link>). Detailed clinical analyses identified five individuals in four independent Indian families who were affected by the same unknown type of SBD (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x2013;d</xref>); the families resided in different geographic areas of India. Pre-natal and early post-natal development were uneventful, but all five showed proportional or short-limbed short stature with variable severity, which was not identifiable at birth (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In addition, the patients had various kinds of head deformities (macrocephaly, dolichocephaly, or prominent forehead), and epicanthic folds and thick vermilion of upper and lower lips were common. Their vision diminished progressively after early childhood due to optic nerve compression, and neither intellectual disability, dental problems, nor chest or spinal deformities were present. Their radiographic features were hyperostosis of the calvaria and the skull base, mild platyspondyly, wide pubis and ischia, broadening of the femoral neck, meta-diaphyseal under-modeling of the long tubular bones, and mild shortening and diaphyseal broadening of the short tubular bones (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e&#x2013;x</xref>), indicating that the disorder belongs to the group of craniotubular dysplasias.

        <p id="Par7">With the pedigrees indicating a likely autosomal recessive mode (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x2013;d</xref>), we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) (Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and identified two homozygous variants, c.222_223insCATG (ClinVar, SCV001446315) in Family A and c.62-5_62-3delTTC (ClinVar, SCV001446316) in Families B&#x2013;D, in <italic>TMEM53</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a&#x2013;d</xref>) that were not present in any known population genetic databases including gnomAD and ExAC.

        <p id="Par8"><italic>TMEM53</italic> has four RefSeq transcripts, here named T.1 (NM_024587.4), T.2 (NM_001300746.1), T.3 (NM_001300747.2), and T.4 (NM_001300748.2), with T.1 showing the highest expression in multiple tissue and cell types (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The variant c.222_223insCATG is located in the coding sequences of T.1 and T.2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), thus causing a frame-shift in exon 3. Because exon 3 is the last exon, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) would not occur. Instead, the mutated T.1 and T.2 would produce two truncated proteins, p.V75Hfs*26 and p.V2Hfs*26 (NP_078863.2), respectively, that lack the transmembrane domain (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par9">The variant c.62-5_62-3delTTC neighbors the intron 1&#x2013;exon 2 junction (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) and is predicted to cause abnormal splicing by multiple online programs (Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). RT-PCR analysis using RNA extracted from the peripheral blood of one affected individual (B-III-18) and their unaffected parents (B-II-4 and B-II-7) who carry c.62-5_62-3delTTC indicated an extra short band (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), which corresponds to a T.3 variant in which exon 2 is skipped during the splicing process (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). As a result, a premature stop codon is generated in exon 3, resulting in a truncated protein, p.N22Afs*7&#x3000;(NP_078863.2), which also lacks a transmembrane domain (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). Unlike the complete loss of normal T.3 in the affected individual, normal T.3 was still detected in the heterozygous parents (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Notably, the band corresponding to T.1 in the normal individual and heterozygous parents did not exist in the affected individual (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), indicating that c.62-5_62-3delTTC leads to complete loss of the T.1 transcript, which has both the highest expression in normal individuals and represents the longest protein coding sequence.</p>
        <p id="Par10">In summary, c.222_223insCATG in Family A potentially generates two truncated proteins (p.V75Hfs*26 and p.V2Hfs*26), and c.62-5_62-3delTTC in Families B&#x2013;D causes T.1 loss and generates one truncated protein, p.N22Afs*7 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). All three truncated proteins lack the transmembrane domain, which is necessary for nuclear envelope targeting of transmembrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To assess their subcellular localization, we expressed these truncated proteins and the corresponding normal isoforms with S-tag in the MG-63 cell line (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) for the tagged proteins indicated that p.V75Hfs*26 and p.N22Afs*7 failed to target the nuclear envelopes, where their normal isoforms were localized (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). T.2 and its truncated protein, p.V2Hfs*26, were expressed on mRNA, but not on protein level (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that the vast majority of genes have a single dominant splice isoform that is translated regardless of the variety of alternative splice variants predicted to exist at the transcript level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Since T.1 shows the highest expression in multiple tissue types, including cartilage (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), and its disruption is a sufficient condition to cause the disease in the patients with c.222_223insCATG (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), T.1 is probably the most important transcript in the developing skeleton.</p>

        <title><italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice recapitulated the human SBD associated with <italic>TMEM53</italic> pathogenic variants</title>
        <p id="Par11">TMEM53 is highly conserved among species and is 86.3% identical between human and mouse (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). To generate <italic>Tmem53</italic>-deficient mice, we introduced deleterious mutations into the coding region by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. A targeting site shared by all six RefSeq transcripts of <italic>Tmem53</italic> was selected to guarantee that the mutation could disrupt all transcripts (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). As a result, three lines with three frame-shift mutations that would produce truncated proteins without a transmembrane domain in all transcripts were established (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5b, c</xref>), and all of the lines showed late-onset short stature. Phenotypes of the line <italic>Tmem53</italic><sup><italic>1bin/1bin</italic></sup> were evaluated in detail in the following experiments.</p>
        <p id="Par12">As summarized in Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, all affected individuals who were homozygous for <italic>TMEM53</italic> pathogenic variants showed normal development until birth and late-onset short stature. Similarly, the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice did not display severe skeletal abnormity at birth (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) but later exhibited late-onset short stature (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). The craniofacial dysmorphias observed in the affected subjects, including tall forehead (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f, k, m, o</xref>) and hypertelorism (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, g, h</xref>), were also found in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, e</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). In addition, the mutant mice showed thickening of the calvaria and minor sclerosis of the skull base (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f&#x2013;i</xref>), which we highlighted for the affected individuals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k, m, o</xref>). Like some other SBDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, the cranial nerve compression caused by bony overgrowth of the cranial nerve foramina also existed in the affected individuals, who had optic nerve compression with resultant vision impairment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref> and Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although the vision of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice was not evaluated in this study, hyperostosis of the skull base (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) and narrowing of the bony fissure relevant to the optic foramen were observed in the mice (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Another radiographic feature of the SBD was platyspondyly, i.e., flattened vertebral bodies throughout the axial skeleton (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1p, s, v</xref>), which was also identified in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3j, k</xref>). With respect to the tubular bones, the patients showed proportionally short limbs and hands, and under-constriction of the diaphyses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1q, t, w</xref>), which were also observed in the mutant mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l&#x2013;m</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

        <title>Enhanced osteoblast differentiation in the calvaria of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice</title>
        <p id="Par13">To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the skeletal phenotypes caused by TMEM53 deficiency, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>Tmem53</italic> in mouse heads. In situ hybridization for <italic>Tmem53</italic> showed high expression in calvaria (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), which were thickened in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>) and the <italic>TMEM53</italic> mutant individuals (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1k, m, o</xref>). Then, the calvaria dissected from the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice and its heterozygous siblings were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). From a total of 14,836 genes on which gene expression profiling was performed, we identified 1278 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). These DEGs were enriched for some Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and the most enriched term was &#x201C;ossification&#x201D; (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), which can be considered as closely related to thickening of the calvaria in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutants, since a calvarium is formed via intramembranous ossification, in which bone develops directly from sheets of undifferentiated mesenchymal connective tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To assess the bone differentiation status of the calvaria, we examined the known marker genes of osteogenic precursors, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in the RNA-seq dataset (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>) and validated the findings by RT&#x2013;qPCR (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Osteogenic precursor and early osteoblast markers <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Sp</italic>7 were increased (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>), suggesting enhanced differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into pre-osteoblasts in the mutant calvaria. Accordingly, the downstream genes of <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Sp7</italic>, <italic>Alpl</italic>, <italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Ibsp</italic>, were upregulated as well (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>). The elevated genes are late osteoblast and osteocyte markers, thus revealing increased bone formation in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice, which was further confirmed by ALP and Alizarin Red (AR) staining of the wild-type and mutant calvaria (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). We also checked the proliferation markers in the RNA-seq dataset, and no significant change was recorded (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

        <title>TMEM53 deficiency overactivates the BMP signaling pathway during calvaria ossification</title>

        <p id="Par15">We then assessed the bone formation capacity of the primary calvaria cells by in vitro induction. The ALP and AR staining showed increased osteoblastic activity and calcification in <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant cells upon induction of osteoblast differentiation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b&#x2013;d</xref>). Notably, the difference of bone formation capacity between wild-type and mutant calvaria cells was increased by BMP2 stimulation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b&#x2013;d</xref>) and ablated by adding K02288, a selective inhibitor of the BMP type I receptor kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). We further evaluated markers of bone formation in response to BMP2 stimulus using MC3T3-E1, a mouse calvaria-derived osteoblastic cell line. Compared to the normal control, cells with <italic>Tmem53</italic> knockdown expressed higher levels of osteoblast markers (<italic>Bglap</italic> and <italic>Alpl</italic>) in response to BMP2 stimulus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>).

        <p id="Par16">To decide whether <italic>TMEM53</italic> regulates the SMAD-dependent BMP signaling pathway, we generated <italic>TMEM53</italic> knockout (KO) human cell lines by deleting the largest exon, which contains 78% of the coding sequence, in Hela cells (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). We used these cell lines in a BMP reporter assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and quantified SMAD-dependent BMP signaling activity.

        <title>TMEM53 deficiency increased nuclear localization of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9</title>
        <p id="Par17">To explore the mechanism that regulates overactivation of SMAD-dependent BMP signaling in the calvaria of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice, we performed ICC for phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 in primary calvaria cells stimulated with BMP2. We found that phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 increased in the nucleus and correspondingly decreased in the cytoplasm (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g, h</xref>), and those findings were supported by Western blot analysis of the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). In contrast, the whole-cell lysate did not show significant changes in the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/9 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>), and neither were Smad1/5/9/4 mRNA levels altered in calvaria RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). These results suggest that overactivated BMP signaling in the calvaria of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice can be attributed to the excessive trafficking of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 into the nucleus rather than to their increased expression or phosphorylation levels. We performed ICC for phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9 in <italic>TMEM53</italic> KO Hela cells and observed the same trend as in the primary calvaria cells of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref>). Thus, the effect of the mutation in mice is equivalent to gene KO with respect to regulation of BMP signaling. Due to the phenotypic similarity between the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice and the individuals with <italic>TMEM53</italic> pathologic variants, it is reasonable to conclude that the previously unknown type of skeletal dysplasia is causally associated with loss-of-function of TMEM53 in regulating the cytoplasm&#x2013;nucleus translocation of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref>). This is further supported by the results of a rescue experiment in <italic>TMEM53</italic> KO cells, in which wild-type TMEM53, but not the truncated TMEM53 protein produced using the patient-derived pathogenic variant, succeeded in restoring the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/9 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k, l</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par18">In this study, we discovered a previously unknown type of skeletal dysplasia with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The observed skeletal changes have some similarities to three diseases belonging to the group of craniotubular dysplasias: craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia (CRMDD, MIM: %269300)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, craniometaphyseal dysplasia, Jackson type (CMD, MIM: #123000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, Joseph-Halliday type (CDD, MIM: #122860)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, definite differences exist between our cases and patients with those SBDs. Although CRMDD also presents with sclerosis of the base of the skull, the calvaria show thinning rather than thickening. Multiple Wormian bones, dental hypoplasia, and frequent fractures are present in CRMDD, but no platyspondyly is found in CRMDD. CMD shows club-shaped metaphyseal widening of tubular bones, while our cases display quite mild metaphyseal dysplasias. Moreover, CMD does not show platyspondyly and under-constricted diaphysis, which are characteristic in our cases. CDD is by far more severe than our cases. CDD is lethal and shows severe craniofacial abnormalities, including distorted faces and prominent jaw. In addition, dental malocclusion and premature loss of teeth are observable in CDD. These obvious differences provide an operable guideline to separate the disorder reported here from the known skeletal dysplasias in clinical practice, supporting the consideration of this disorder as a previously unreported clinical entity that we suggest designating as craniotubular dysplasia, Ikegawa type.</p>
      <p id="Par19">So far, two skeletal disorders are known to be explicitly related to BMP-signaling: Myhre syndrome caused by <italic>SMAD4</italic> pathogenic variants (MIM: # 139210)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and BMPR1B-related brachydactyly (MIM: # 609441, # 616849, # 112600)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but both show no hyperostosis. The previously unknown disorder identified in this study shows a strong relationship with BMP signaling, thus probably being the only hyperostosis caused by overactivity of BMP signaling. As the other branch of TGF-&#x3B2; family signaling, overactivity of TGF-&#x3B2; signaling is considered to be the mechanism of Camurati&#x2013;Engelmann disease (MIM: # 139210)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The hallmark of Camurati&#x2013;Engelmann disease is the cortical thickening of diaphyses of the long bones, which was not found in our cases.</p>
      <p id="Par20">In our study, multiple pieces of genetic and biological evidence from humans and mice indicate that the previously unknown type of SBD is caused by loss-of-function of TMEM53. TMEM53 deficiency leads to overactivation of the BMP signaling pathway, which plays key roles in craniofacial development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Overactivated BMP signaling during intramembranous ossification would cause hyperostosis with resultant calvarial thickening, which were observed in both human and mouse <italic>TMEM5</italic>3 mutants. Notably, besides the enhanced osteoblastogenesis in the mutant calvaria, we found an asymmetrical change in TRAP5 (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) staining (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), which suggests a defect in osteoclastogenesis, which probably also contributed to the dysregulated ossification. The defective osteoclastogenesis may be a change secondary to the defective osteoblastogenesis due to the close coupling of bone formation and resorption during calvarial remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the unequal distribution of TRAP staining is only due to the asymmetrical skull development, which is mirrored by the dysmorphic coronal sutures in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). Cranial sutures serve as growth centers composed of two osteogenic bone fronts on either side of the sutures. Maldevelopment of cranial sutures causes dysmorphogenesis of skulls in humans and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and BMP signaling participates in the regulation of cranial suture morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Thus, the dysmorphic coronal suture can be linked to the overactivated BMP signaling and contribute to the craniofacial dysmorphism in human and mouse <italic>TMEM53</italic> mutants.</p>
      <p id="Par21">Besides cranial phenotypes, under-constriction or under-modeling in the meta-diaphyses of the mildly shortened tubular bones were another feature of the affected individuals with <italic>TMEM53</italic> pathogenic variants, and comparable phenotypes were evident in the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice as well (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3l, m</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). These findings suggest interrupted coordination of interstitial growth and appositional growth of tubular bones. Interstitial growth, also referred to as cartilaginous growth, elongates tubular bones by endochondral ossification in the growth plate. The specific expression pattern of <italic>Tmem53</italic> in the proliferative and pre-hypertrophic zones of the growth plate supports its functional involvement in the elongation of tubular bones (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a</xref>). In the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice, we observed a thickened growth plate in the femur (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16b, c</xref>), and prior studies have shown that BMP signaling is important for growth plate regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Together with our observations that <italic>Tmem53</italic> knockdown increased BMP2-induced chondrocyte markers in chondrogenic ATDC5 cells (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16d&#x2013;f</xref>), these results suggest <italic>Tmem53</italic> deficiency promotes chondrogenesis in the growth plate by overactivating BMP signaling. The enhanced chondrogenesis would disturb normal ossification in the growth plate and result in delayed growth in the length of tubular bones. In contrast to interstitial growth, appositional growth is a process of periosteal bone shaping, which determines the contour and diameter of tubular bones by coupling bone formative and resorptive activities beneath the periosteum. Unlike endochondral ossification in growth plates, periosteal bone shaping of tubular bones is similar to intramembranous ossification of the calvaria. The failure in the process manifests as &#x201C;under-constriction&#x201D; or &#x201C;under-modeling&#x201D; of meta-diaphyses in several known human bone dysplasias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>Tmem53</italic> is highly expressed in the periosteal zone of tubular bones as well as in the calvaria (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a</xref>). These lines of evidence imply that the under-modeling of the meta-diaphyses of the tubular bones in human and mouse <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutants could be caused by a potential defect in periosteal bone shaping stemming from a molecular mechanism similar to that revealed for calvaria.</p>
      <p id="Par22">TMEM53 belongs to the family of NET proteins, which were identified based on their subcellular localization at the nuclear envelope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As the boundary between the cell nucleus and cytoplasm, nuclear envelopes are formed by a specialized domain of the endoplasmic reticulum, where two closely juxtaposed lipid bilayers constitute a double-membrane sheet, the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM). Nuclear envelopes serve as a protective shell for the genome and a versatile communication interface between nucleus and cytoplasm. Pathogenic variants in NET proteins cause monogenic diseases, including muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, loss-of-function of an INM protein called the LEM domain containing 3 (LEMD3) results in a special SBD spectrum, osteopoikilosis (MIM: #166700)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our study provides the second case wherein deficiency of a NET protein induces SBD, thus reinforcing the functional link between NET proteins and the regulation of bone density. Besides SBD, <italic>TMEM135</italic>, which encodes another NET protein, was identified as a susceptibility gene for osteoporosis in several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. These ever-growing lines of evidence suggest that the NET protein family could play hitherto unknown roles in bone metabolism as it relates to health and disease.</p>
      <p id="Par23">The study of TMEM53 function at the tissue and organism levels has not been reported previously. As far as we know, the only report about TMEM53 function is an in vitro research report indicating that TMEM53 affects cell cycle regulation in some cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. However, the RNA-seq data of the calvaria of the <italic>Tmem53</italic> mutant mice did not show changes in proliferation markers (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Also, the in vitro culture of the primary calvarial cells did not show any difference in the cell growth (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). The inconsistent findings imply that the effect of Tmem53 on cell cycles may depend on tissue and cell types as revealed by the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Instead, we found that TMEM53 deficiency promoted osteoblast differentiation by overactivation of BMP signaling. The BMP signaling pathway plays key roles in bone formation and development, and its intracellular regulation is realized by the modulation of the SMAD proteins. Our study reveals that TMEM53 prevents the nuclear accumulation of SMAD1/5/9 without affecting their levels of expression and phosphorylation. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of the SMAD proteins occurs through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. NPCs are assembled by multiple copies of ~30 different nucleoporins, which form a hydrophobic channel through the nuclear envelope. The trafficking process refers to multiple rounds of interaction among SMADs, transport receptors, and nucleoporins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As an ONM protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, TMEM53 might be engaged in these interactions to hamper SMAD1/5/9 translocation into the nucleus (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5m</xref>). The underlying mechanism by which TMEM53 functions as a gate-keeper of BMP-SMAD signaling at the nuclear membrane needs further study.</p>
