        <title>SUMMARY</title>
        <p id="P3">Kinesins are canonical molecular motors but can also function as modulators of intracellular signaling. KIF26A, an unconventional kinesin that lacks motor activity, inhibits growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2)- and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent signal transduction, but its functions in the brain have not been characterized. We report a patient cohort with biallelic loss-of-function variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>, exhibiting a spectrum of congenital brain malformations. In the developing brain, <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> is preferentially expressed during early and mid-gestation in excitatory neurons. Combining mice and human iPSC-derived organoid models, we discovered that loss of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> causes excitatory neuron-specific defects in radial migration, localization, dendritic and axonal growth, and apoptosis, offering a convincing explanation of the disease etiology in patients. Single-cell RNA-sequencing in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> knock-out organoids revealed transcriptional changes in MAPK, MYC and E2F pathways. Our findings illustrate the pathogenesis of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss-of-function variants, and identify the surprising versatility of this non-motor kinesin.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p id="P4">The kinesin superfamily proteins are canonical molecular motors that transport protein complexes or organelles along microtubules by ATP hydrolysis (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Niwa, 2015</xref>). Through their interactions with microtubules and regulation of microtubule dynamics, many KIFs are involved in cellular processes such as mitosis, migration and neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Niwa, 2015</xref>). In addition, some kinesins play additional roles in signal transduction by regulating the intracellular localization of signal protein complexes and mediating the strength of the signal (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Konjikusic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Midorikawa et al., 2006</xref>). Abnormal kinesin functions have been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental diseases (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Asselin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Janisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P5"><italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> encodes a member of the Kinesin-11 family, which also includes <italic toggle="yes">KIF26B</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SMY1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">VAB8</italic> (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Miki et al., 2005</xref>). However, KIF26A does not function in microtubule-based transport, since its divergent motor domain can bind to microtubules but cannot hydrolyze ATP (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). In mouse enteric neurons, Kif26a directly binds to the signal transduction adaptor protein Grb2 and inhibits Grb2/SHC complex formation, thereby disrupting RET tyrosine kinase activation and subsequent signaling through the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Besset et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Kif26a also recruits focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to cytoplasmic microtubules, sequestering FAK from phosphorylation by integrin-activated Src family kinase (SFK) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Calalb et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, via its binding to microtubules, Kif26a functions as a microtubule stabilizer such that loss of Kif26a causes dysregulation of microtubule dynamics (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit megacolon, enteric neuronal hyperplasia and defective neurite outgrowth (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), but the role of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> in the central nervous system has not yet been characterized. Here, we show that biallelic variants in human <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> are associated with a spectrum of congenital brain malformations. Combining <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> animal and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> human brain organoid models, we found that KIF26A is critical for normal brain development, not as a microtubule-based motor, but instead as a modulator of intracellular signaling pathways that control radial migration, neurite and axon growth, and apoptosis of cortical excitatory neurons.</p>

        <title>Identification of Biallelic Variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> in Patients with Congenital Brain Malformations</title>
        <p id="P6">As part of a rare variant, family-based genomics approach by exome sequencing (ES) to identify genes associated with brain malformations, we found 5 unrelated subjects with congenital brain malformations who had inherited biallelic mutations in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> (NM_015656.1, hg19) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) but no other rare, segregating, or likely damaging candidate variant alleles (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). A01, the proband of Family A (BAB10995), who was recently identified among a Turkish neurodevelopmental disorder cohort (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Mitani et al., 2021</xref>), presented with microcephaly (&#x2212;3.45SD) and an MRI suggesting a component of cerebral atrophy, as well as dysmorphic features and ileus with megacolon. Brain MRI at 3 months of age showed reduced white matter, ventriculomegaly and a thin corpus callosum (CC) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This consanguineous family had six other children who died in infancy for whom limited clinical records indicated that several of them shared central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal abnormalities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). ES revealed an inherited homozygous frameshift variant in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> c.3440dupC, p.Ala1148Cysfs*20 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>), predicted to cause complete loss of KIF26A expression. This variant is absent in normal individuals in the gnomAD v3 database. B01 from Family B (PED026C), was diagnosed prenatally with bilateral schizencephaly at 21 weeks gestation. Other abnormalities included shortened CC (&#x2212;3.1 SD), high arched palate and long philtrum, and absence of a stomach bubble on ultrasound (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). MRI from fetopsy after termination confirmed the bilateral schizencephaly and further revealed abnormal grey-white matter differentiation, with an abnormally fused molecular layer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). ES revealed biallelic, compound heterozygous variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>: c.2161C&gt;T, p.Arg721Cys, and c.4676C&gt;T, p.Ala1559Val, segregating in accordance with Mendelian expectations for an autosomal recessive (AR) disease trait (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>). C01 from Family C (SHE_1305), is a male born to non-consanguineous parents with mild developmental delay and learning disability. A brain MRI at 18 years demonstrated agenesis of the CC and an enlarged anterior commissure, absent hippocampal commissure, colpocephaly, decreased white matter volume, and present Probst Bundles (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). ES revealed inherited compound heterozygous variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>: c.4676C&gt;T, p.Arg1624Cys, and c.4870C&gt;T, p.Ala1559Val (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>). D01 from Family D (PMG_14800) was diagnosed with polymicrogyria and hydrocephalus, with inherited compound heterozygous variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>: c.2845C&gt;T, p.Pro949Ser, and c.4676C&gt;T, p.Ala1559Val (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>). MRI images from D01 were not available for review. E01 from Family E (BAB5949) is a male born to consanguineous parents with growth retardation and developmental delay. Brain MRI performed at 18 months revealed a thin CC, ventriculomegaly and polymicrogyria (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Exome sequencing demonstrated homozygous variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>: c.4804C&gt;T; p.Arg1602Trp (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1E</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">The missense variants identified are distributed widely in the protein but all involve amino acids that are highly conserved across mammalian species (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1F</xref>), suggesting - along with the mode of inheritance - a loss-of-function (LoF) model of disease. Gain-of-function or &#x201C;dominant negative&#x201D; is highly unlikely, because none of the parents or siblings carrying heterozygous variants exhibited any neurological abnormalities (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). There are three discernable globular domains in KIF26A predicted by AlphaFold 2 (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), but most of the identified variants reside in the disordered chain between the kinesin motor domain and a C-terminal helical module implicated in FAK binding (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1G</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">H</xref>). The c.4676C&gt;T, p.Ala1559Val variant shared by 3 of our subjects is present in normal individuals in the gnomAD v3 database (AF: 0.000975) but no homozygotes are observed, consistent with a heterozygous carrier state for a recessive disorder. Overall, these five families associate biallelic <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> mutations with corpus callosum defects, ventricular abnormalities, cortical malformations on the polymicrogyria/schizencephaly spectrum and additional variable brain and systemic abnormalities.</p>

        <title>Patient <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> missense variants express at reduced level and lose microtubule stabilizing function</title>
        <p id="P8">The diverse biallelic mutations, observed AR inheritance pattern, and absence of neurological phenotypes in carrier parents in the cohort lead to our hypothesis that the pathogenesis of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> mutations is due to LoF. We transfected expression constructs for wild-type (WT) and patient variant forms of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> in HEK293T cells, a cell type with no baseline <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression, and found that WT and all 4 tested variants can be expressed exogenously from the plasmid, and the variant proteins displayed normal cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). However, Western blot revealed that all of the variant KIF26As expressed at significantly lower levels than WT KIF26A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that the patient variants cause partial LoF likely due to destabilization of the protein.</p>
        <p id="P9">In human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY5Y, overexpression of WT KIF26A, but not variant KIF26As, stabilizes microtubules, making them resistant to depolymerization induced by Nocodazole treatment, a small molecule commonly used for this purpose (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>) (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Vasquez et al., 1997</xref>). This loss of the microtubule stabilizing function of KIF26A further supports the pathogenicity of the missense variants. As SHSY5Y cells have high baseline KIF26A expression, we also tested the effect of partial KIF26A loss by shRNA-induced knock-down (KD) and found that KIF26A depletion reduced the abundance of acetylated tubulin and detyrosinated tubulin, indicating that normal KIF26A expression is required to maintain microtubule stability in these neuron-like cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). Missense proteins produced from the variants often have altered configuration and stability, which may underlie the reduced expression level and loss of microtubule stabilizing function in the KIF26A variants. We evaluated the impacts of the variants using a machine learning-based computational predictor, MUpro(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>) and the prediction results showed with high confidence values that the patient KIF26A missense variants would likely decrease protein stability and predict deleterious effects (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C</xref>). Together, these results provide strong evidence that the missense variants discovered in our patients impair KIF26A function, consistent with the AR inheritance pattern from our genetic analysis.</p>

        <title><italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> is Preferentially Expressed by Migrating Excitatory Neurons in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</title>
        <p id="P10">Analysis of the developmental transcriptome data from the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) showed that <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression was enriched in the first and second trimesters (up to gestational week (GW) 26) of embryonic development, with expression decreasing rapidly entering the third trimester and becoming undetectable after birth (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This expression pattern was consistent across the anterior-posterior axis in the cortex, and temporally overlaps with the primary periods of the radial migration of cortical excitatory neurons (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Rakic, 2009</xref>). Analysis of single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of mid-gestation (GW17-18) human fetal cortex (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Polioudakis et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons, with low expression in at least a fraction of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and little expression in inhibitory neurons and radial glias (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression was more enriched in the Migrating Excitatory Neurons (ExN) cluster compared to the Maturing Excitatory Neurons (ExM) cluster (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting a reduction in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression as cortical neurons mature after completing migration, consistent with the temporal dynamics in bulk samples. We validated the expression of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> in the cortical plate (CP), subplate (SP) and intermediate zone (IZ) of mid-gestation human fetal cortex using <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Kif26a expression was detected with a similar pattern in E16.5 mouse cortex (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>), suggesting potentially conserved roles of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> in rodent and human brain development.</p>

        <title><italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> loss Disrupts Radial Migration of Cortical Excitatory Neurons</title>
        <p id="P11">We depleted Kif26A from migrating cortical neurons in mice using <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> electroporation (IUE) of E13.5 mice with three short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) validated by RT-PCR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>), and observed defective excitatory neuronal migration. Four days after IUE (E17.5) into the dorsal forebrain, the vast majority (~98%) of mCherry<sup>+</sup> electroporated cells expressed the late-born cortical neuron marker Satb2, while a very small proportion expressed IPC marker Tbr2 (~2%) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C</xref>). This proportionality is consistent across control and <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD, indicating that <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD did not impede neuronal differentiation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD induced by all three shRNAs caused strong radial migration defects compared to scrambled shRNA controls, with many KD neurons stalled in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the ventricular zone (VZ), while the control neurons reached the upper layer of the cortical plate (CP) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Notably, this defect was related to radial migration but not neuronal differentiation or fate choice, because despite their abnormal localization, the KD cells stalled in the SVZ and VZ expressed Satb2 but not Tbr2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3C</xref>), and many KD neurons exhibited multipolar morphology instead of normal bipolar morphology, a deficit characteristic of impaired radial migration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). While not as pronounced as E17.5, the migratory defect was also detected earlier at E15.5 (2 days after IUE), as quantitative analysis showed abnormal laminar localization of KD neurons (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Similarly, overexpression (OE) of human KIF26A in the mouse cortex also caused a strong migrational defects with many OE neurons arrested in the VZ or SVZ, suggesting that abnormally increased Kif26a expression may also be detrimental (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). Lastly, we examined cell death in control and <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic>-KD brains using TUNEL staining and found no significant differences at either E15.5 or E17.5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4A</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). Our embryonic mouse data provides strong evidence that Kif26a is essential for radial migration of cortical excitatory neurons specifically, and that loss of Kif26a disrupts migration in a cell-autonomous manner.</p>

        <title><italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> Loss Impairs Neuronal Localization, Morphology and CC Development in Mouse Brain</title>
        <p id="P12">Examination of electroporated mouse brains at P5 (10 days after IUE) revealed that the defect of migration is permanent, leading to a lasting mis-localization of excitatory neurons. While control electroporated neurons localized to the upper layers (II and III) of the cortex and formed a condensed uniform layer, <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD neurons failed to reach the same destination and were scattered throughout layers II to VI (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">H</xref>), revealing that the migratory defect persisted to result in impaired terminal localization postnatally. Moreover, control electroporated neurons showed developed pyramidal morphology with a basal dendrite and multiple apical dendrites, as well as visible long descending axons. In striking contrast, KD neurons mostly retained an immature morphology with short basal dendrites (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). Since the neurons born around E13.5 were mostly upper layer callosal projection neurons, control mCherry<sup>+</sup> neurons at P5 sent out long axons that formed the axonal bundle to cross the CC and reach the contralateral hemisphere. However, CC crossing was completely blocked in <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD neurons with no mCherry-labeled axons found in the axonal bundle (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">L</xref>). This observation was fully consistent across all the samples we examined at P5, as 100% (10 out of 10 mice) of control IUE brains and 0% (0 out of 10 mice) of <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD brains showed mCherry-labeled axons crossing the CC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Nevertheless, the overall morphology of the CC appeared normal in the brains electroporated with <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> shRNA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>), demonstrating that Kif26a loss disrupted axonal development cell-autonomously in electroporated neurons only, as the majority of cells were not electroporated and thus the gross CC formation was unaffected. These results illustrated that normal Kif26a function is required for CC development and this dependence establishes a strong association between <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> LoF and the CC abnormalities seen in our patients (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).</p>

        <p id="P13">To investigate the impact of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss in human neuronal development, we generated two pairs of isogenic homozygous <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> knockout (KO) human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines using CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>). We differentiated <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> KO (referred to as KO) and the isogenic control (wild type, WT) iPSCs into cortical excitatory neurons. Automated high throughput imaging and machine learning-based neurite analysis revealed KO neurons showed shorter neurite length than WT neurons 5 days after plating, persisting to at least Day 21 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), consistent with the neuronal morphology defects observed in <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Similar neurite outgrowth defects have previously been reported for <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KO mouse enteric neurons, and were potentially associated with disrupted microtubule stability due to Kif26a loss (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). We next differentiated iPSCs into forebrain neurospheres, and found that neuroblasts from the KO neurospheres migrated significantly shorter distances than control cells 2 days after attaching to a Matrigel-coated plate, and this defect could be rescued by restoration of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>).</p>

HiPSC-derived forebrain organoids produce cell types highly reminiscent of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> counterparts, and recapitulate the formation of an organized radial glia scaffold that supports the radial migration of excitatory neurons, offering a more representative model than monolayer or neurosphere neuronal cultures (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bershteyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Pasca, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2020</xref>). All tested WT and KO iPSC lines consistently differentiated into forebrain organoids with well-defined cortex-like cytoarchitectures forming CP-like, SVZ-like and VZ-like layers (referred to as CP, SVZ and VZ for short) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6C</xref>). Throughout various stages of WT forebrain organoid development, KIF26A was expressed specifically by excitatory neurons in the CP and SVZ, co-localizing with neuronal markers DCX, CTIP2, SATB2 (shown by immunostaining), and <italic toggle="yes">RORB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RBFOX3</italic> (NeuN) (shown by ISH) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>), faithfully recapitulating the expression pattern in the developing human cortex. Neurogenesis of early-born (CTIP2<sup>+</sup>) and late-born excitatory neurons (SATB2<sup>+</sup>) appeared normal in KO organoids, and KIF26A expression did not display neuronal subtype preferences (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6F</xref>). We separately characterized the proliferation of SOX2<sup>+</sup> TBR2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> radial glia and TBR2<sup>+</sup> IPC in KO organoids and did not find significant changes in the abundance of dividing cells and the division angle of ventricular radial glia (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6G</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">I</xref>).</p>

        <title>KIF26A Regulates Neuronal Radial Migration in Forebrain Organoids via FAK signaling</title>
        <p id="P15">We analyzed radial migration of new-born neurons in WT and KO organoids by EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) birth-dating and saw a striking neuronal radial migration defect. We pulsed organoids with EdU at Day 53 and Day 70, and detected EdU-labeled cells after an 8-day chase period (<xref rid="S15" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Because EdU taken up by a dividing cell is diluted each time a progenitor cell divides, only postmitotic neurons born at the time of EdU exposure show high fluorescence intensity 8 days later, allowing us to track neurons born at a known birth-date and measure the distance they migrated (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that in both WT and KO organoids, the majority of EdU-labeled cells 8 days post exposure are CTIP2<sup>+</sup> TBR2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> excitatory neurons (~93%), while the rest are TBR2<sup>+</sup> CTIP2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> IPCs (~7%). This confirmed that neuronal differentiation was unperturbed in KO organoids (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In WT organoids, KIF26A was expressed in EdU-labeled neurons, but the expression was completely abolished in KO organoids (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7A</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). While most EdU-labeled CTIP2<sup>+</sup> TBR2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> neurons in WT organoids migrated to the upper layer of the CP after 8 days, many labeled neurons in the KO organoids were found in the SVZ, suggesting stalled or arrested radial migration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">G</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C</xref>), consistent with the defect observed in <italic toggle="yes">Kif26a</italic> KD mouse brains. This migratory deficit is specific to neurons, because EdU-labeled TBR2<sup>+</sup> CTIP2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> IPCs showed the same laminar localization in KO organoids as in WT (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). KIF26A&#x2019;s known binding target, FAK, has been reported to specifically regulate excitatory neuron radial migration but not interneuron tangential migration, and both loss and overexpression of FAK led to arrest of excitatory neurons in the mouse cortex (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Valiente et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Yokota et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with KIF26A&#x2019;s inhibition of FAK phosphorylation (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), phospho-FAK was more abundant in the CP of KO organoids than WT (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7D</xref>). Remarkably, when we treated WT and KO organoids during the EdU chase period with a selective FAK inhibitor, GSK2256098 (GSK), the localization of EdU-labeled neurons in KO organoids were restored to the CP, resembling WT organoids (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). The rescue effect of FAK inhibition strongly suggests that KIF26A regulates radial migration via a FAK-dependent mechanism.</p>

The increase in apoptotic cells in KO organoids was specifically limited to the SVZ, suggesting that the apoptotic cells included migratory neurons (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), although the identities of cleaved-caspase 3<sup>+</sup> cells could not be determined due to the loss of marker expression after cells commit to apoptosis. While FAK inhibition with GSK rescued the migratory defect, apoptosis remained high in GSK-treated KO organoids, suggesting that KIF26A regulates apoptosis independent of FAK (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7E</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>).</p>

After quality control filtering, we identified 9 distinct cell clusters annotated based on expression of well-known cell-type markers (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Girskis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Polioudakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pollen et al., 2015</xref>), including dividing progenitor cells, outer and ventricular radial glia, intermediate progenitors, inhibitory neurons and three groups of cortical excitatory neurons of different maturation stages (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The fidelity of cell-type classification was validated by the remarkable agreement when comparing organoid datasets to a compiled fetal human cortex atlas (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8A</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). The cells from WT and KO organoids integrated well without noticeable segregation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8C</xref>), and each individual organoid analyzed from both WT and KO lines contained all cell types at similar proportions, indicating high reproducibility of our organoid differentiation, and confirming our earlier finding that <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss does not perturb progenitor differentiation or alter cell-type composition (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8D</xref>). Expression of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> was specifically enriched in Migrating Excitatory Neuron (MigEx) and Maturing Excitatory Neuron (MatEx) clusters (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with the cell type-specificity in human fetal cortex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Pseudotime analysis revealed MigEx cells were at an earlier maturation stage than MatEx, and MigEx had the strongest enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expression (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), supporting <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>&#x2019;s role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons.</p>
        <p id="P18">Because our data strongly support cell-autonomous mechanisms acting specifically on excitatory neurons, we focused on the two <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> expressing clusters (MigEx and MatEx) for further analysis. Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) between KO and WT cells identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two clusters. <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> KO cells showed downregulation of several known regulatory genes involved in neuronal apoptosis, such as <italic toggle="yes">NRP1, PARP2, BMF</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TAF12</italic> and upregulated genes included many genes involved in apoptosis and the MAPK pathway, such as <italic toggle="yes">MAPK14, JAK2, ARRB1, RIPK2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TRAF7</italic>, consistent with the previous report that KIF26A suppresses the MAPK pathway via inhibition of GRB2-mediated signaling (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8E</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>). Immunostaining for NRP1 (neuropilin-1) showed exclusive expression in the SVZ, and validated its downregulation in KO organoids (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). Top gene ontology (GO) terms of significantly downregulated genes in MigEx included regulation of &#x2018;p53 signal transduction&#x2019; and &#x2018;negative regulation of neuron apoptotic process&#x2019; (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p id="P19">Combining human genetics with <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models for functional characterization, we discovered that <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> regulates radial migration, dendritic and axonal development and apoptosis in excitatory neurons, and is critical to normal corticogenesis and corpus callosum development. Because we first established that the missense variants identified in our patients cause at least partial loss of KIF26A function, our LoF experiments offer direct insights into the etiology underlying the patients&#x2019; developmental abnormalities. Our KO organoid experiments are especially analogous to Patient A01, who carries a homozygous frameshift mutation that completely abolishes <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> function. The association between <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> and the aforementioned developmental processes is strengthened by the high coherence in the patients&#x2019; phenotypic presentations. Abnormalities characterized by dilated ventricles and reduced white matter, associated with axonal developmental defects, are seen in all 4 patients in which axonal patterns could be studied. Cortical malformations including microcephaly, polymicrogyria and schizencephaly (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Moffat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2018</xref>), are seen in 4 of the 5 patients. Defective CC development is seen in all 4 patients for whom adequate MRI data were available to evaluate the CC.</p>
      <p id="P20">Although many kinesins have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, KIF26A is unique because it does not function as a molecular motor, but instead modulates signal transduction via direct binding to FAK and GRB2 (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). The remarkable cell-type and temporal expression specificity of KIF26A also distinguishes it from most other kinesins with characterized functions in the CNS (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Konjikusic et al., 2021</xref>), highlighting its critical requirement specifically for embryonic brain development. We propose a model in which KIF26A (1) regulates dendritic and axonal growth as a microtubule stabilizer, and thus regulates white matter and CC development; (2) regulates radial migration and terminal localization via FAK inhibition; (3) and regulates neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting GRB2-mediated signaling pathways (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>
      <p id="P21">One significant advantage of our study is the multipronged approach using multiple model systems to obtain coherent functional discovery, which synergistically strengthens the plausibility of our conclusions. The defects in dendritic and axonal development in mice echoes our finding that the KO human iPSC-derived neurons had shorter neurites. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss perturbed radial migration and localization of excitatory neurons in both mouse and human organoids, which can be pharmacologically rescued by selective inhibition of FAK. While we only observed increased apoptosis in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> KO organoids, but not in electroporated mouse brains, one explanation for this difference is that KO organoids model complete LoF, similar to Patient A01 with a homozygous frameshift, who is the only patient diagnosed with cerebral atrophy, which typically reflects increased apoptosis. In contrast, incomplete KD induced by shRNA IUE in the mouse brain did not cause dramatic increase in apoptosis despite the neuronal mis-localization, recapitulating the partial LoF in patients carrying biallelic missense mutations. An alternative interpretation is that KIF26A&#x2019;s regulation of neuronal apoptosis is a function specific to humans, but not mice. While we do not have sufficient evidence to support this interpretation, we resorted to scRNAseq comparison in human organoids to investigate the pathways and genes affected by <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss specific to human cortical development.</p>
      <p id="P22">Our scRNAseq analysis offers molecular insights into the unexpected transcriptional regulatory functions of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic>, which may underlie the apoptosis phenotype. GO analysis and GSEA revealed disruption of MAPK, E2F and MYC pathways, echoing two very recent studies also reporting KIF26A&#x2019;s involvement in MYC and E2F pathways in cancer (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that KIF26A&#x2019;s inhibition of GRB2-dependent growth factor signaling modulates the MAPK and E2F pathways, either directly or indirectly, and subsequently the MYC pathway, which may explain the transcriptional changes that cause elevated apoptosis in KO organoids (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>) (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, <italic toggle="yes">NRP1</italic>, the most strongly downregulated gene in the KO MigEx cluster, has been reported to be a regulator of p53-transduced signals and is crucially required for CC development (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Piper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2007b</xref>). NRP1 is the receptor for the critical callosal axonal guidance molecules SEMA3A and SEMA3C (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Niquille et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), and loss of NRP1 has been shown to impede callosal axon growth cell-autonomously and disrupt CC formation (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Piper et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, NRP1 is a direct target regulated by the E2F pathway, the most significantly downregulated pathway in our KO organoids (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>)(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we propose that KIF26A is required for callosal axon development by a combinatorial mechanism of regulating microtubule stability and modulating the expression of NRP1 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). Taken together, our findings on the non-motor functions of KIF26A reveal a greater versatility of functions within the kinesin superfamily, and underscore their roles in development and diseases.</p>

        <title>Limitations of the study</title>
        <p id="P23">One limitation of our study is that the mouse and human organoid experiments modeled <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss instead of directing characterizing the pathogenic effects of the missense variants discovered in the patients, because we do not have access to patient-derived iPSCs. To circumvent this limitation, we combined patient genetics analysis and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cellular assay to establish that the pathogenicity of the missense variants is due to LoF, and then focused on characterizing the developmental impairment caused by <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss. Another limitation is that we could not directly illustrate the molecular pathways via which GRB2-mediated signaling is responsible for the gene expression changes and elevated cell death in KO organoids. Our current study provides indirect evidence from scRNAseq comparison in KO and WT organoids, which showed dysregulation of GRB2-mediated pathways including MAPK, MYC and E2F. While our study has illustrated that <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss underlies these dysregulations, in-depth biochemistry in more simplistic models to characterize the detailed molecular changes upon <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> loss is a direction for follow-up investigation.</p>

Brain MRI at 3m of age showed reduced white matter and a thin corpus callosum (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Aa</xref>-<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). This consanguineous family had six other children who died in infancy, but on whom clinical details are sparse and genetic testing not available. Exome sequencing revealed inherited bi-allelic frameshift variants in <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> (p.Ala1148Cfs*20). Additional siblings who died in early life included: (1) a male sibling who died at 1.5 month without phenotyping, (2) a female sibling who died at 3 month with presumed ileus, (3) a male sibling who died at 4 month with ileus, hydrocephalus and hypotonia, (4) a female sibling who died at 1 year with no clinical information, (5) a male sibling who died at 2 month with esophagus atresia, esophagus trachea fistula, anus atresia/fistula, Dandy walker malformation and congenital hypothyroidism hypospadias, (6) a male sibling who died at birth with no clinical information.</p>
          <p id="P33">B01, identified from Family B (PED026C), was diagnosed prenatally with bi-lateral schizencephaly at 21 weeks gestation. Other abnormalities included high arched palate and long philtrum, identified on fetopsy after termination. This patient was also noted to have an absent stomach bubble on prenatal imaging. Fetopsy MRI confirmed the bilateral schizencephaly and further revealed abnormal grey-white matter differentiation, with an abnormally fused molecular layer (though too early in gestation to call polymicrogyria specifically) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1Ac</xref>-<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).

          <p id="P34">C01, identified from Family C (SHE_1305), is a male born to non-consanguineous parents at 41 weeks via emergency c-section after a pregnancy complicated by borderline gestational diabetes. He experienced fetal distress and ingested meconium during the end of labor and delivery, though the nursery course was not complicated. SHE_1305 has mild developmental delay, pulling to stand at 12 months, and walking up/downstairs at 24 months.

          <p id="P39">CRISPR-Cas9-mediated KIF26A KO in PGP1 and 280 iPSC lines was performed by Synthego (Redwood City, CA). Briefly, guide RNAs was designed to create a frame-shift insertion at the fourth (for PGP1) and third (for 280) exon of <italic toggle="yes">KIF26A</italic> (Chr14: 104,624,154 and Chr14:104, 618, 554) and maximize the number of mismatches with other sequences in the genome to reduce off-target effects. Guide RNAs (CGGCCCUGAUGGCUUGUCGA for PGP1; CCAGCACCACGACCAGCUCG for 280) were synthesized and complexed with SpCas9 to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNP were transfected into the iPSCs via electroporation together with positive control sgRNA (RELA). Transfected cell pool was analyzed with Sanger sequencing to confirm successfully edits. The edited pool is used to seed single cells for clonal expansion. Each well seeded is imaged every 2-3 days and tracked to ensure the population is truly clonal and only the progeny of a single cell. Two clones were selected and passed characterization of genotyping with sanger sequencing, karyotyping by KaryoStat, viability test, mycoplasma test and pluripotency tests.</p>

Subjects were identified and evaluated in clinical settings, and biological samples were collected for research purposes after obtaining written consent. These studies were approved by the necessary institutional review boards; PMG14801 (Family D), Boston Children&#x2019;s Hospital and Montreal Neurological Institute; SHE_1305 (Family C), University of California San Francisco; PED026C (Family B), Women&#x2019;s and Children&#x2019;s Hospital in Adelaide (IRB number: HREC15/WCHN/35); BAB10995 (Family A) and BAB5949 (Family E), Baylor College of Medicine (IRB approval number: H-29697). The cases in this cohort were ascertained and processed using a variety of different methods but connections were made using MatchMaker Exchange.</p>
          <p id="P43">WES and data processing for PMG21801, SHE_1305 and PED026C was performed by the Genomics Platform at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT (Cambridge, MA, USA). Whole exome sequencing was done on DNA samples (&gt;250 ng of DNA, at &gt;2 ng/&#x3BC;L) using Illumina exome capture (38 Mb target). The exome-sequencing pipeline included sample plating, library preparation (2-plexing of samples per hybridization), hybrid capture, sequencing (150 bp paired reads), sample identification QC check, and data storage. The hybrid selection libraries cover &gt;90% of targets at 20x and a mean target coverage of ~100x. The exome sequencing data was de-multiplexed and each sample&#x2019;s sequence data were aggregated into a single Picard BAM file. Exome sequencing data was processed through a pipeline based on Picard, using base quality score recalibration and local realignment at known indels. The BWA aligner was used for mapping reads to the human genome build 37 (hg19). Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) were jointly called across all samples using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller package version 3.4. Default filters were applied to SNP and indel calls using the GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) approach. Lastly, the variants were annotated using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). For additional information please refer to Supplementary Section 1 of the paper describing ExAC (Lek et al., 2016). The variant call set was uploaded on to Seqr and analysis was performed using the various inheritance patterns. Candidate variants were validated further by Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis was performed on unaffected siblings using Sanger sequencing.</p>
          <p id="P44">For BAB10995 and BAB5949, and their family, next-generation, massively parallel Exome sequencing (ES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were performed at the Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) at BCM through the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics initiative.24 For exome sequencing after quality control (QC), libraries were prepared with various methods over a span of time. Each new method was validated prior to implementation. Pre-capture libraries were prepared using Phusion or KAPA Hyper reagents, then pooled into 4-plex library pools and hybridized in solution to the HGSC-designed Core capture reagent 29 (52 Mb, NimbleGen) or 6&#x2013;10-plex library pools that used the custom VCRome 2.1 plus custom Spike-In design (42Mb, NimbleGen) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s specifications, with minor revisions. Paired-end sequencing was performed for all samples in a format of multiplexed pools to generate an average depth of coverage of 1193 using the Illumina HiSeq2000 or NovaSeq6000 instrument. With an average sequencing yield of 11.5 Gb, the samples achieved 97% of the bases covered to a depth of 203 or greater.</p>

Cells were collected in mTeSR plus medium supplemented with 10&#x3BC;M ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, and seeded into 24-well AggreWell microwell culture plate at 1.5 million cells per well to make embryoid bodies (EBs) of 5,000 cells, followed by centrifuging at 100g for 3 minutes. On Day 1, EBs were transferred from AggreWell to ultra-low attachment 6 well plate with a wide-bore P1000 pipette, and cultured on an orbital shaker placed in the incubator at 100 rotations per minute (rpm) to prevent EBs from aggregating. mTeSR plus medium and EB Medium (AggreWell EB formation medium supplemented with 2 &#x3BC;M Dorsomorphine, 2 &#x3BC;M A83-01 and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin) were mixed 1:1 for Day 1. On Day 2 and Day 4, full medium change was performed with EB Medium. On Day 5 and Day 6, half of the medium was replaced with Induction Medium consisting of DMEM:F12, 1X N2 Supplement, 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin, 1X Non-essential Amino Acids, 1X GlutaMax, 1 &#x3BC;M CHIR99021, and 1 &#x3BC;M SB-431542. Medium was changed every two days to Day 20. On Day 20, about 50 neurospheres were transferred to one Matrigel-coated chamber slides (Southern Labware) and placed stationary to allow neurospheres to adhere to the surface. The neurospheres were spread on the chamber slide to ensure sufficient distance separating neurospheres and their migratory areas. Two days later (Day 20+2), the neurospheres on chamber slides were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS and ready for immunohistochemistry followed by imaging. For the rescue experiment, iPSCs were infected with lentivirus expressing mCherry-CMV&gt;hKIF26A on the passage before EB formation (Day &#x2212;7).</p>
          <p id="P61">For comparison of the neuroblast migration distances between control and KIF26A KO neurospheres, random neurospheres were imaged using Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted fluorescent microscope. The entire area including all the neuronal processes and migrating cells around a neurosphere was imaged and tile stitching was used when necessary. The distances of DCX<sup>+</sup>, Pax6<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells migrating away from the bulk of the neurosphere were then manually measured in ImageJ software in a blinded manner, and statistically analyzed in Excel and GraphPad Prism. The frequency distribution of distances was calculated for each individual neurosphere before being averaged for graphical representation.</p>

The VZ was defined by exclusive SOX2 immunoreactivity and neural tube-like morphology at the ventricular (apical) surface. The SVZ was defined by the region containing mixed population of SOX2<sup>+</sup>, CTIP2<sup>+</sup> and TBR2<sup>+</sup> nuclei outside the VZ. The CP was defined by the region from the boundary of the SVZ to the outer (basal) surface containing exclusively CTIP2<sup>+</sup> nuclei. The relative layer thickness analysis was performed similarly to previously described method (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2016a</xref>). Random cortical structures were imaged under a confocal microscope and 15 &#x3BC;m z-stacks were projected with maximum intensity in ImageJ software. After defining the boundaries of each layer, the layer thickness was measured in ImageJ in a blinded manner. For each cortical structure, three measurements were taken at 45&#xB0; angle pointing towards the basal surface and taken average. The relative layer thickness for each layer is calculated by normalizing layer thickness to the sum of VZ, SVZ and CP thicknesses.</p>

Cortical structures were randomly imaged under a confocal microscope at the single z-plane. For neuronal migration analysis, the positions of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> and TBR2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei were manually marked using the &#x201C;Cell Counter&#x201D; plugin in ImageJ in a blinded manner. Their y-coordinates on the image were recorded and normalized to the total distance from apical to basal surfaces of cortical structures to measure their relative laminar positions. The frequency distributions of the relative vertical positions in 10 evenly divided bins of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> and TBR2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> EdU+ nuclei were calculated and plotted in GraphPad Prism software. IPC localization analysis was performed similarly, but only CTIP2<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and TBR2<sup>+</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei were manually marked.

        <p id="P93">Individual organoids are treated as biological replicates, unless otherwise indicated in the Figure Legends. Data are presented as mean &#xB1; S.E.M. or mean + S.D., unless otherwise indicated in the Figure Legends. Statistical analyses were performed using the student&#x2019;s t-test in Excel or Prism software. Significance was defined by P-value &lt; 0.05. Organoid samples were randomly taken from the culture for experiments and analysis. Sample sizes are determined empirically. The sample sizes are designed to account for the variability between organoids and human iPSC cell lines and match current standards in human brain organoid-related studies. Other statistical details of experiments can be found in the Figure Legends. No data were excluded.</p>

Sagittal (a) and axial (b) T2-weighted images of subject A01 at 3 months of age demonstrate reduced cerebral white matter volume (notably the corpus callosum (CC)) with supratentorial ventriculomegaly and cerebral atrophy. Sagittal (c) and axial (d) T2 weighted postmortem brain MRI of B01 (pregnancy ended at gestational week (GW) 21) demonstrate full thickness defects affecting the parietal lobes (black arrows). Note that tissue decomposition/swelling distorts brain morphology. Sagittal T1 (e) and axial T2 (f) images of subject C01 at 17 years of age demonstrate complete agenesis of the CC with preservation of the anterior commissure (white arrow) and colpocephaly. Mid-sagittal T2 weighted (g), axial T2 weighted (h), and coronal T1 weighted images (i) of subject E01 demonstrate increased thickness, gyral frequency, and haziness of the inferior right temporal cortex (circled in h and i) consistent with cortical dysplasia and polymicrogyria, with thinning of the CC (g).</p>
