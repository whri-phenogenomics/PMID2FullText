      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0010">Genomic inversions are segments of DNA where the sequence is present in the reverse orientation compared with the reference. In human populations, such rearrangements are spread all over the genome and have a wide range of sizes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A range of complexity is typically seen,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and the mutational mechanisms underlying these types of rearrangement are becoming better understood.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Inversions differ in frequency, ranging from benign common polymorphisms to private <italic>de novo</italic> variants that predispose to disease. Inversions can cause disease through both loss- and gain-of-function mechanisms, the latter via creation of gene fusions or by changing regulatory landscape, which can lead to aberrant gene expression. Although inversions can be identified by traditional karyotyping approaches, such methods typically cannot identify rearrangements &lt;10 Mb in size. Over the last 20 years, karyotyping has gradually been replaced by copy number variant (CNV) analysis using array-based testing or by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S1</xref>). Initially, microarrays were constructed using large insert clones spaced at &#x223C;1-Mb intervals.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Gradual improvements in resolution/throughput combined with reductions in cost have meant that array testing has been adopted by the majority of clinical genetics laboratories, often as the first-line genetic test.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Therefore, although the rapid technical progress in array technologies has led to substantial improvements in diagnostic yields (and more generally in our understanding of the role of CNVs in human disease), copy-neutral structural variants (SVs), such as inversions, have in comparison been overlooked by clinical testing laboratories. Consequently, the relative importance of inversions and other types of balanced rearrangement remains elusive.</p>
      <p id="p0015">The UK&#x2019;s 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP) was a large national study that aimed to uncover the genetic basis of disease for individuals with rare disease (RD) and cancer in whom a diagnosis had not been obtained by standard-of-care testing.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> A secondary aim was to build upon evidence from previous studies<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and demonstrate the feasibility of genome sequencing as part of standard clinical practice within the National Health Service (NHS). More background about the 100kGP is provided in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S2</xref>. The diagnostic yield obtained across 2,183 families with RD in the initial pilot phase of the 100kGP was 25%.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, this was only after significant input from the research community, which included the detection of 22 non-coding variants and a total of 40 SVs. Although SV calls from Manta<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> (a split-read variant caller) were reviewed, none of the 40 SVs were inversions or complex SVs.

      <p id="p0030">The main clinical analysis pipeline utilized as part of the 100kGP has focused largely on small variants called by Platypus.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Variant prioritization is based on gene sets derived from PanelApp,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> a tool that uses crowdsourcing to gather expert knowledge and establish a consensus for high-quality diagnostic gene panels. For the majority of 100kGP participants, DNA was extracted from EDTA blood. Library preparation used the TruSeq PCR-free high-throughput kit, and sequencing was performed using 150-bp paired reads on a HiSeqX machine (Illumina). SVs were called using both Canvas v.1.3.1<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and Manta v.0.28.0<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and combined into a single structural vcf file. As Canvas detects only CNVs, Manta calls were utilized for the present study. Genomic data available for the 100kGP cohort comprise a mix of genome builds (GRCh37 and GRCh38). For the inversion-positive individuals identified in the present study, 12/47 were originally analyzed on GRCh37.</p>
      <p id="p0035">In order to prioritize SV calls from the 100kGP, we used SVRare<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">web resources</xref>) and a MySQL database that hosted 554,060,126 SVs from 71,408 participants across 33,924 families with RD. Coordinates for the SVs called on the GRCh37 subset of genomes were converted to GRCh38 using the LiftOver tool (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">web resources</xref>). Clustering the SV calls using an overlap threshold set&#xA0;to 80% allowed us to filter for ultra-rare inversion calls detected by Manta. Large multiplex families are uncommon in the 100kGP, and so we prioritized variants observed with an apparent allele count of 5 or less.</p>
      <p id="p0040">Rare inversions were filtered for those likely to disrupt a set of 351 genes for which HI is a well-established disease mechanism.

At least one breakpoint had to lie within the gene region. Where both breakpoints lay inside the same gene, the inversion call had to span at least one coding exon, such that the SV would likely disrupt gene function. Larger inversions that invert an HI gene but leave it fully intact were deprioritized. GRCh38 gene coordinates were based on ENSEMBL release v.105. For higher confidence, we utilized &#x201C;PairSupport&#x201D; information available from the Manta output. One additional inversion was ascertained due to an unusual pattern of clustering for a filtered set of &#x201C;TIERED&#x201D; single-nucleotide variants (SNVs).</p>

        <p id="p0075">A total of 62 affected individuals from 47 independent families harboring 46 different SVs were detected on account of a MantaINV call (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S2</xref>). For all these variants, &#x201C;Researcher identified potential diagnosis&#x201D; forms were submitted to be considered for entry to the diagnostic discovery pathway. Requests to contact the recruiting clinicians were made concurrently. Overall, six genes were hit twice, and these included: <italic>MSH2</italic> (exemplar 1, MIM: 609309), <italic>MECP2</italic> (exemplar 2, MIM: 300005), <italic>GLI3</italic> (MIM: 165240), <italic>AUTS2</italic> (MIM: 607270), <italic>CDKL5</italic> (MIM: 300203), and <italic>ARID2</italic> (MIM: 609539). For 14/47 families (30%), the gene found to be disrupted had been strongly suspected, as evidenced by previous targeted sequencing or MLPA testing (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S2</xref>).</p>
        <p id="p0080">The size of the inversions ranged over six orders of magnitude, with the largest two above 30 Mb in size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>A). The mean and median sizes were 3.51 Mb and 635 kb, respectively. The largest inversion was a <italic>de novo</italic> 36.4-Mb variant (chrX:18,472,998&#x2013;54,910,892, GRCh38) that disrupts <italic>CDKL5</italic> in an individual with intellectual disability and seizures, consistent with a diagnosis of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 2 (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="300672" id="intref0010">300672</ext-link>).

This variant had been identified in parallel with the 100kGP by karyotyping and has now been confirmed by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>B). This individual (Family 19) had been recruited to 100kGP due to early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC, aged 27 years old), and this was assumed to be a cryptic form of Lynch syndrome due to the significant family history (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S1</xref>).

Despite having only short-read data for this family, phasing the <italic>de novo</italic> SV was possible using four informative SNPs that lie close to breakpoints (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S9</xref>).

          <title>Other types of complex SV</title>
          <p id="p0125">Other complex SVs were identified that did not fit into discrete subtypes. One such SV was identified in a female proband (Family 30) recruited to 100kGP due to a clinical suspicion of ectodermal dysplasia. Other features included bilateral talipes (from birth), conical teeth, and slightly fine scalp hair. Height and head circumference were within the normal range. Nails were noted to be slightly thin, especially those of her great toes. Overall, there were clear though mild features of ectodermal dysplasia, and <italic>EDAR</italic> (MIM: 604095) variants had been excluded prior to recruitment to the 100kGP. A resemblance to the X-linked hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia form (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="305100" id="intref0070">305100</ext-link>) was noted, despite episodes of heat intolerance not being reported. Two MantaINV calls of 377 kb and 340 kb were identified, each with a breakpoint lying in intron 1 of <italic>EDA</italic> (MIM: 300451). Closer scrutiny of the data showed that the rearrangement involved two non-tandem duplications that had been inserted into <italic>EDA</italic> at the site of a 42-kb deletion (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#xA0;S10</xref>A and S10B). The rearrangement was ambiguous with short-read data, with three possible configurations (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S10</xref>C), although all would likely be disruptive for <italic>EDA</italic> function. The SV was also shown to have arisen <italic>de novo</italic> and occurred on the paternal chromosome, a finding that could be of value if accurate recurrent risk estimates are needed.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref></p>
          <p id="p0130">Another unusual SV was identified in Family 39, where two immediately adjacent inversions of 3.9 Mb and 1.4&#xA0;Mb had been detected. The middle of the three breakpoints disrupted intron 20 of <italic>CUL4B</italic> (MIM: 300304; GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_003588.4" id="intref0075">NM_003588.4</ext-link>) (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S11</xref>)<italic>.</italic> This boy had been recruited to the DDD study<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> (which did not pick up any likely pathogenic variants) and then to the 100kGP, with a diagnosis of intellectual disability, severe global delay, and seizures.

Although the father had been recruited to the 100kGP coded as affected, from the limited information available his condition appeared to be much less severe than that seen in his son.

        <title>Validation status</title>
        <p id="p0140">Our analysis was performed on a clinical cohort spread across the UK and involving many different GLHs. The experience and resources available for validation and reporting of complex SVs from the 100kGP varied across these GLHs. These efforts are therefore ongoing, and data on these aspects are incomplete. To the best of our knowledge, &#x223C;18&#xA0;months after reporting this set of variants, 28/47 (60%) of the SVs reported here have now been confirmed at the DNA level, with a range of orthogonal approaches (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables&#xA0;S2</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).

For 2/6 participants, retrospective analysis of these exome data was able to validate the SV. The first of these was the individual with a blended phenotype (Family 12, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S3</xref>). The complex SV involving <italic>EFTUD2</italic> (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_004247.4" id="intref0085">NM_004247.4</ext-link>) removes exons 3&#x2013;6 and partially deletes exon 7. As the exon 7 breakpoint lies right in the middle of the exon (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#xA0;S12</xref>A and S12B), it is not surprising that it was captured by the exome data (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S12</xref>C).</p>

          <p id="p0160">Of the 10/47 individuals followed up using long-read genome sequencing, nine had been included in Genomics England&#x2019;s pilot study using PacBio HiFi technology. For another participant, long-read genome sequencing was performed independently with nanopore sequencing. In every instance, all SV breakpoints were validated, with no additional complexity being identified.</p>
          <p id="p0165">In 4/10 individuals where the structure of the SVs had been interpreted as unambiguous from short-read data, long-read data helped confirm the prior SV interpretation. These included Family 43 with a complex but copy-neutral translocation disrupting <italic>APC</italic> (exemplar 4), Family 12 described above (<italic>EFTUD2</italic>), and Family 2 with a translocated inversion disrupting <italic>FH</italic> (MIM: 136850) (described below).

This includes two individuals (Families 33 and 47) with complex SVs involving the final exon of <italic>MECP2</italic>, where PacBio data resolved the SVs, and these findings directly influenced clinical interpretation. These results are described in more detail below (exemplar 2). The four remaining complex SVs could not be resolved with PacBio data. This was due to the presence of large duplicated segments that could not be spanned by HiFi reads, which typically extend to just above 20 kb in length. These included complex SVs in Families 25, 30, 31, and 41, involving <italic>COL4A5</italic>, <italic>EDA</italic>, <italic>KDM6A</italic>, and <italic>PDHA1</italic>, respectively.

Most notable among these was Family 36, where the proximal breakpoint of a 764-kb inversion (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S14</xref>) lay in intron 1 of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> (MIM: 600855; GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_001347721.2" id="intref0100">NM_001347721.2</ext-link>). This individual was recruited to the 100kGP with a diagnosis of intellectual disability, but additional features included deep-set eyes, a prominent nasal bridge, short stature, hirsutism, and epilepsy. There was significant microcephaly (between &#x2212;4 and &#x2212;5 SDs), and MRI investigations demonstrated delayed myelination, especially subcortical white matter atrophy, pons, and cerebellum. The SV had arisen <italic>de novo</italic>, and the clinical features were thought to be consistent with intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 7 (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="614104" id="intref0105">614104</ext-link>). However, because the translation start site lies in exon 2, the coding sequence is intact, and thus some diagnostic uncertainty remained.

This reported incidence will have been influenced by the degree of prior testing performed before families were recruited to the 100kGP. For many disease areas, ruling out the most likely candidate gene(s) was a prerequisite for enrollment, and in the RD pilot, a median of 1 genetic test (range 0&#x2013;16) had been undertaken.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> A similar analysis of complex SVs using genome sequencing data as a first-line test would likely result in a lower incidence of such SVs, as the cohort would still contain many cases with non-cryptic variants in strong candidate genes.

The wider clinical impact of inversions across the full complement of human genes is also unknown (see <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">discussion</xref>).</p>

In two individuals, the genes involved lie at each end of the inversion, whereas the other two affected individuals harbor a second independent pathogenic SNV, unrelated to the inversion.</p>
          <p id="p0200">The first participant with a suspected blended phenotype involves <italic>GLI3</italic> and <italic>HOXA13</italic> (MIM: 142959; Family 22, described previously<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>). The 14.8-Mb inversion disrupts <italic>GLI3</italic>, and the affected individuals had features consistent with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome. However, several other features were more in keeping with hand-foot-genital syndrome (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="140000" id="intref0130">140000</ext-link>), and prior testing had focused on <italic>HOXA13</italic>. The distal breakpoint of the inversion lay &#x223C;45 kb upstream of <italic>HOXA13</italic>. Positional effects for <italic>HOXA13</italic> have been proposed to act over much longer distances.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
          <p id="p0205">Another participant with a suspected blended phenotype was identified, and this involved a <italic>de novo</italic> inversion on 22q13.2 in a girl (Family 18) recruited to 100kGP due to ocular coloboma and an abnormality of ocular abduction. As well as visual impairment, the participant had mild global developmental delay, kyphoscoliosis, morphological abnormality of the semi-circular canal, and syndactyly. The proximal and distal breakpoints of this 1.0-Mb inversion disrupt <italic>EP300</italic> (MIM: 602700) and <italic>TCF20</italic> (MIM: 603107), respectively (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S18</xref>). As these are both well-established OMIM morbidity genes, and both are intolerant to loss-of-function variations (pLI&#xA0;= 1), we considered that the individual&#x2019;s phenotype could be due to HI of both genes. At the time of entry into the 100kGP, the individual was too young for it to be clear whether typical features of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome 2 (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="613684" id="intref0135">613684</ext-link>) were present, but subsequent assessment has confirmed typical facial features and broad hallux.</p>
          <p id="p0210">Family 4 was recruited to the 100kGP as a parent-child trio, the proband and father with a diagnosis of ear malformations and hearing impairment. This family was already considered to be solved, due to an inherited likely pathogenic c.662A&gt;G (p.Asn221Ser) (GenBank: NM_000248.4) variant in <italic>MITF</italic> (MIM: 156845), a gene associated with Waardenburg syndrome, type 2A (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="193510" id="intref0140">193510</ext-link>). However, bone exostoses were an additional complication in both affected individuals, and this feature is not typically observed in individuals with Waardenburg syndrome. Both individuals shared a 106-kb inversion (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S19</xref>) that involves exons 2&#x2013;10 of the 14-exon <italic>EXT2</italic> gene (MIM: 608210; GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_207122.2" id="intref0145">NM_207122.2</ext-link>) and hence is highly likely to disrupt gene function and result in the bone phenotype. This finding will facilitate genetic testing of an affected brother (not in the 100kGP) who has multiple exostoses, but not deafness. Confirmation of the inversion in this individual would help delineate the components of this blended phenotype.

          <p id="p0215">A notable subset of the cohort (10/47 families) harbored germline inversions that disrupted tumor suppressor genes and resulted in well-known cancer susceptibility type conditions.</p>
          <p id="p0220">The 30.7-Mb inversion disrupting <italic>MLH1</italic> (described above) will facilitate cascade testing in the 100kGP participant&#x2019;s son and other at-risk family members in this large kindred. Positive history for cancer had gone back at least three generations and included an affected brother (CRC, 28 years old) and paternal uncle (CRC, 42 years old; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S1</xref>). Microsatellite instability had also been confirmed in two family members. Although immunohistochemistry indicated loss of MLH1, previous germline testing had not yielded a pathogenic variant. Original genome sequence data, generated in March 2016, were initially analyzed using build GRCh37, and the 100kGP clinical pipeline had flagged only c.86G&gt;C (p.Gly29Ala) (GenBank: NM_000535.7) in <italic>PMS2</italic> (MIM: 600259), which is likely benign (VCV000041721.56).</p>
          <p id="p0225">The proband in Family 1 was a young female with a classical juvenile polyposis phenotype (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="174900" id="intref0150">174900</ext-link>) who first presented with intussusception at 7 years. Recent colonoscopies demonstrated juvenile polyps. Targeted testing of <italic>SMAD4</italic> (MIM: 600993) and <italic>BMPR1A</italic> (MIM: 601299) had not identified any candidate germline susceptibility variants, and therefore the individual was recruited to the 100kGP together with her similarly affected mother. A 1.4-Mb inversion on 10q23 was identified in both affected individuals (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S20</xref>), for which the proximal breakpoint lies in intron 1 of <italic>BMPR1A</italic> (GenBank: NM_004329.3). As the first exon is 5&#x2032; UTR, we intend to perform follow-up studies using informative exonic SNPs (rs35572415 and rs7078571) for allelic imbalance experiments to confirm the effect of this SV on transcription. The inversion has been validated using a triple-primer multiplex PCR assay, and thus cascade testing can now be offered to at-risk family members.</p>
          <p id="p0230">Family 2 comprised a proband and her daughter both recruited to the 100kGP due to cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas. Although no renal cancer had been reported in&#xA0;this family, there was a strong suspicion of an underlying germline variant in <italic>FH</italic>. Prior testing with targeted sequencing and MLPA did not uncover any likely diagnostic variants. We detected a complex SV with a breakpoint in the in the final intron of <italic>FH</italic> (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S21</xref>A), consistent with leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="150800" id="intref0155">150800</ext-link>). Although our prioritization was due to the Manta algorithm, which called this SV as a 3.6-Mb inversion, the actual structure was an intrachromosomal translocation of a 193-kb segment, in combination with a 188-kb deletion (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#xA0;S21</xref>B and S21C). The consequence of the insertion on the <italic>FH</italic> transcript would require RNA studies. However, the inserted sequence contains one&#xA0;positive-strand RefSeq annotation for &#x201C;POTE ankyrin domain family, member F pseudogene&#x201D; (GenBank: NR_027247.2), and so we speculate that the SV may result in a fusion transcript. As the variant was also detected in the proband&#x2019;s affected daughter, there is support from co-segregation. Cascade testing is now being extended to include other affected family members. We anticipate that this finding will be important for prioritizing renal cancer surveillance, especially for male relatives where the endometrial phenotype cannot act as a &#x201C;giveaway&#x201D; clue about whether individuals are likely carriers and thus at risk of the more aggressive cancer type.</p>
          <p id="p0235">Family 3 comprised an individual entered into the 100kGP as a singleton with a diagnosis of &#x201C;genodermatoses with malignancies.&#x201D; Other features included punctate palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, thyroid adenoma, macrocephaly, and tongue nodules. Although the phenotype was considered classic for Cowden syndrome (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="158350" id="intref0160">158350</ext-link>), previous testing of <italic>PTEN</italic> using targeted sequencing and MLPA approaches had not picked up any variants of significance.

          <p id="p0240">Family 8 comprised an individual with multiple tumors recruited to the 100kGP as a singleton. She was diagnosed with unilateral retinoblastoma (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="180200" id="intref0170">180200</ext-link>) in 1971 and subsequently osteogenic sarcoma of the left tibia in 1981. Malignant melanoma and uterine leiomyosarcoma were also reported more recently. Although the pedigree was not available to review, extensive family history of osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, and breast cancer was noted. Several malignancies were reported to have somatic mutations in <italic>RB1</italic> (MIM: 614041), but targeted sequencing of <italic>RB1</italic> in constitutional DNA did not pick up any pathogenic variants. Our analysis identified an 18.1-kb inversion, with the distal breakpoint lying in intron 2 of <italic>RB1</italic> (GenBank: NM_000321.3), and a 2,246-bp loss at the proximal end (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S23</xref>). Unfortunately, the individual is now deceased, which makes it difficult to re-contact this family to offer validation/cascade testing.</p>
          <p id="p0245">Family 40 comprised a male recruited as singleton to 100kGP under a diagnosis of familial tumor syndromes of the central and peripheral nervous system. SVRare had prioritized a 15.1-Mb inversion call that involved <italic>NF2</italic>.

Although linkage analysis had already revealed a risk haplotype for markers around <italic>NF2</italic>, detection of this SV will facilitate cascade testing in other at-risk family members.

The first individual (Family 16) is a male recruited to the 100kGP with reported transitional cell cancer of bladder at 42 years and cecal cancer at 45 years. Positive family history of early-onset cancer stretched back at least three generations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>B) and led to a strong clinical suspicion for Lynch syndrome. Microsatellite instability was demonstrated in DNA from cecal tumor (5/5 markers). Immunohistochemistry highlighted a complete loss of MSH2 expression and reduced MSH6 expression in both bladder TCC and cecal tumors. Germline testing using both targeted sequencing and MLPA approaches was unrevealing. Karyotyping (46XY) and array-CGH had also returned normal results. There was no evidence for loss of heterozygosity at any of the <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>, or <italic>MSH6</italic> loci. However, somatic testing identified a single <italic>MSH2</italic> variant in 20% of reads.

Bowel cancer was also reported in her now-deceased father and brother (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>B), and so the family background was again considered to be classic for Lynch syndrome. Given the complexity of the rearrangement and the identical breakpoints shared between both individuals, we speculated that the variant was a founder variant. Although haplotype analysis was limited by the&#xA0;fact that genome sequencing in each family was performed on just the proband, a 3.2-Mb region where there is absence of conflicting homozygosity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>C) was identified, supporting a founder origin. The maximal coordinates of this shared region are defined by A&gt;C transversions at rs115321698 and rs13420048, where the alternate allele was homozygous in Family 16 but not detected in Family 17 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S26</xref>). Analysis of ultra-rare variants further supported the founder origin hypothesis, and the 13 shared SNVs identified (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S4</xref>) may be useful to screen for other individuals carrying this inversion.

After a period of normal or slow development (7&#x2013;18&#xA0;months), individuals show arrested development, regression of acquired skills, and loss of speech. Ataxia, stereotypic movements (e.g., distinctive uncontrolled hand clapping/rubbing), acquired microcephaly, seizures, intellectual disability and autistic-like behaviors are often reported. The same variants that cause Rett syndrome in females are considered lethal or else result in a much more severe presentation in males. Classically affected males have been described harboring mosaic variants or in individuals with an extra X chromosome (i.e., Klinefelter syndrome, 47,XXY). In this study, two 100kGP participants with MantaINV calls were identified in which small inverted segments were part of more complex rearrangements, and both involved the final coding exon of <italic>MECP2</italic>.</p>

Other features included microcephaly, seizures, delayed motor development, and ataxia. Autistic behavior, recurrent hand flapping, and inappropriate laughter were also noted. Although Manta detected two overlapping inversions, closer scrutiny of the locus suggested a complex maternally inherited SV involving a 1,130-bp deletion and a 681-bp duplication (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>A). Due to the size of the duplication, which could not be spanned using short paired-read data, the configuration of this SV was ambiguous.

There was significant global developmental delay and microcephaly. She demonstrated periods of fast irregular breathing, and there were no purposeful hand movements. At the time of last review, age 8, she was able to walk a few steps aided. She had no meaningful words and communicates through picture exchange. She developed multi-focal seizures from 5 years of age. Array testing in 2013 (80&#xA0;&#xD7;&#xA0;60K v.2.0, ISCA platform) had identified a maternally inherited microduplication at 7q36 considered not to be significant. Sequence analysis and MLPA of <italic>MECP2</italic> a year later identified no pathogenic variants. In 2015, a differential diagnosis of Angelman syndrome was pursued, which included testing with methylation-specific PCR methods. However, there was no evidence of a deletion, uniparental disomy, or an imprinting defect at the <italic>UBE3A</italic> locus. The family was&#xA0;then recruited to the 100kGP as a parent-child trio, and genome sequencing was performed in 2017.

Although the MantaINV call in <italic>MECP2</italic> prioritized by SVRare suggested an inversion of 209&#xA0;bp, close scrutiny of the locus with the short- and long-read data available suggested a complex rearrangement comprising a 76-bp inverted duplication close to a similar-sized deletion. However, MantaBND calls also showed the presence of a 14.5-kb duplicated segment from 19qter, which had inserted into the middle of the SV (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#xA0;S27</xref>A and S7B).

          <p id="p0300">The proband in Family 43 (I-1; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>A) first presented with tiredness and shortness of breath aged 25 and lost considerable weight over the next 5 years. He had stomach cramps and was diagnosed later with hundreds of polyps and colorectal cancer, requiring colectomy. This presentation was thought to be in alignment with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome (FAP [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="175100" id="intref0200">175100</ext-link>]). This was investigated using MLPA and an 18-gene bowel panel test, but no likely-pathogenic variants were found. Although the proband&#x2019;s oldest son (II-1) was asymptomatic, at age 15 years an endoscopy was performed to exclude any polyposis similar to that seen in his father. At the hepatic flexture, a single sessile serrated polyp was detected. No other polyps were identified, and so the significance of this single polyp was unclear. The second-oldest son (II-2) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (MIM: 222100) aged 3 years and autism spectrum disorder aged 11. At 13, he experienced intermittent bouts of diarrhea (no blood and no mucus) and sometimes reported stomach pain. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed to investigate a polyposis syndrome as well as celiac disease for the diarrhea. The colonoscopy showed multiple small polyps. The microscopic pictures show some lymphoid tissue from the Peyer&#x2019;s patch in the terminal ileum, as well as several large colon mucosa focal tubular adenomas, and low-grade dysplasia identified in several biopsies. Over 100 adenomas were identified aged 15 years (including focal tubular adenoma). Follow-up endoscopies confirmed polyposis and tubular adenoma and low-grade dysplasia. A number of investigations to identify a genetic cause (in particular <italic>APC</italic> variants) were unrevealing. The youngest son (II-3) also underwent a colonoscopy aged 10, and &gt;100 adenomas were identified, confirming polyposis with histology tubular adenoma and low-grade dysplasia.<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure&#xA0;6</label><caption><p>Clinical and genetic characteristics of Family 43 with a complex translocation involving the <italic>APC</italic> locus</p><p>(A) Pedigree including proband and the three male offspring, of whom two share the complex translocation (INV).

          <p id="p0305">In summary, the family pedigree (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>A) strongly suggested a dominant genetic cause, and family history was consistent with a clinical diagnosis of FAP. The endoscopic (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>B) and histological features (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>C) were also consistent with FAP, but multiple genetic investigations, including the targeted testing described above as well as the initial analysis of genome sequencing data&#xA0;from the 100kGP, did not reveal a genetic cause. A further complication was the fact that the oldest son had just a single polyp, and so it was unclear whether this was a chance finding or represented delayed progression of a genetic polyposis syndrome. Given this uncertainty, this elder brother had not been recruited to the 100kGP.</p>
          <p id="p0310">Re-analysis of genome sequencing data using SVRare revealed a 4.2-Mb MantaINV call with a breakpoint in intron 4 of <italic>APC</italic> that was predicted to disrupt gene function. However, manual assessment of read-level data detected additional split-read pairs mapping to multiple junction sites (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>D). Overall, the pattern of nine rearranged genomic segments was suggestive of a complex chromosomal translocation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>E). A translocation involving chromosomes 5 and 7 was subsequently confirmed by FISH. Long-read genome sequencing using PacBio HiFi reads helped validate all respective breakpoints (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>F). Finally, PCR analysis using two sets of primers, followed by nanopore sequencing, confirmed the two clinically relevant breakpoint junctions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;6</xref>G).</p>

RNA-seq for the proband (II-2) indicated that only the non-reference alleles were expressed (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S16</xref>).

          <p id="p0320">The finding of a complex translocation, now validated using multiple methods, allowed us to make a definitive genetic diagnosis in the three affected individuals from Family 43.

This finding will inform clinical management in terms of the regularity/necessity for ongoing colorectal cancer surveillance.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="p0325">In this study, we utilized data from 33,924 families in the RD program of the 100kGP with the aim of investigating the role of inversions in genetic disease via HI. Our study also included complex SVs that were detected due to an inversion call. Although 62 individuals from 47 families were nominated for inclusion into the diagnostic discovery pathway for follow-up, two were subsequently refuted, and so the final yield was 45/33,924 families. This represents only 1%&#x2013;2% of the total diagnoses across the 351 genes assessed. A notable finding was that for the vast majority (87%) of SVs, the inversion was below 10 Mb in size and thus would be too small to be detected by karyotyping (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>A). We also found that 20/47 of the SVs reported here were confirmed to have arisen <italic>de novo</italic>. This was not a requirement for the initial SV prioritization steps (which only needed an allele count of 5 or lower), so this is strong evidence supporting pathogenicity for this collection of variants.</p>
      <p id="p0330">Our reported incidence (&#x223C;1/750 families) likely represents an underestimate of the overall impact of inversions in RD for several reasons. Firstly, our analysis was limited to inversions that disrupted known HI genes. Our list of 351 genes (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S1</xref>) represents &lt;10% of the 4,836 genes known to harbor phenotype-causing mutations listed in OMIM (August 31, 2023) and was taken from the Clinical Genome Resource, whose curations are conservative and&#xA0;do not include disease-gene associations described recently. For instance, <italic>SRRM2</italic> (MIM: 606032) was not included in this list despite good evidence for a role in intellectual disability via HI,<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref> and we note that three participants with deletion-inversions (likely palindrome-mediated) involving this gene were identified recently in the 100kGP.<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0335">Secondly, this study did not scrutinize SVs that disrupt genes linked to autosomal recessive conditions. Two such examples from the 100kGP are described in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S5</xref>. Performing a systematic analysis of inversions across the entire 100kGP for genes linked to recessive conditions is confounded by several factors: (1) unless the SV is homozygous, one has to identify a second hit variant and assess pathogenicity for both variants in tandem; (2) even if one finds a strong second hit, not all families from 100kGP are parent-child trios, so with limited access to long-read sequencing data, phasing information is incomplete; and (3) allele frequency filtering would need a less stringent cut-off. In the future, long-read genome sequencing will largely solve the problem of phasing rare variants and may also help identify additional SVs where breakpoints lie in repetitive regions. The 150-bp reads used here could potentially have missed inversions where the breakpoints lie in Alu/LINE1 elements, pseudogenes, or any region where there is high sequence homology.</p>
      <p id="p0340">Several genes were recurrently impacted by inversions in this cohort. Families 37 and 38 both harbored inversions disrupting <italic>AUTS2</italic> (GenBank: NM_015570.4). The respective breakpoints in intron 2 and 5 are not nearby, and so there is no indication of a mutational hotspot (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S29</xref>). <italic>AUTS2</italic> has a large genomic footprint of 1.2 Mb and so simply represents a greater mutational target for rearrangements to occur. Several structural rearrangements in this gene linked to intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 26 (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="615834" id="intref0205">615834</ext-link>), have been reported previously.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr"><sup>56</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0345">In contrast, the recurrent disruption of <italic>MSH2</italic> was due to the same founder variant being detected in two independent families from the UK. An identical <italic>MSH2</italic> rearrangement was identified in an Australian proband by cDNA sequencing and inversion PCR in 2016, with an AluY-mediated recombination model being hypothesized to explain its origin.<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> The same primers used in that study were used for validation for the individuals identified here. A second proband was subsequently detected as part of a replication effort that tested 55 individuals with unsolved Lynch syndrome,<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><sup>57</sup></xref> and that individual was re-reported by Brennan et&#xA0;al.<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> The 3.2-Mb haplotype shared between Family 16 and Family 17 described here (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S4</xref>) represents formal confirmation of a founder origin. Recent genome sequencing of the second proband described by Liu et&#xA0;al.<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr"><sup>58</sup></xref> has confirmed that the inversion in that individual lies on the same founder haplotype (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S4</xref>). This exon 2&#x2013;6 <italic>MSH2</italic> inversion was estimated to have arisen around 30 generations ago. As a rule of thumb, shared segments of 2&#x2013;5 Mb are most likely inherited from a common ancestor &gt;20 generations ago,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref> but this depends on local recombination rates. The two families reported here and the second individual reported by Liu et&#xA0;al.<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr"><italic><sup>57</sup></italic></xref> all have recent ancestors from the same region in northern England. Further genealogy studies linking the two UK families with both Australian families or else performing additional analyses of identity-by-descent would give a more precise estimate. Given the founder origin and cryptic nature of this rearrangement, it is important that the prevalence of this inversion is assessed in other suitable populations where (1) Lynch syndrome is suspected and (2) loss of MSH2 has been confirmed at the protein level. In one follow-up study, Morak et&#xA0;al. screened 48 MSH2-deficient affected individuals from a German population but did not find this exon 2&#x2013;6 inversion,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> suggesting this founder variant to be of more westerly European origin. MRC Holland are investigating whether probes for this inversion can be incorporated into one of their probe-mixes in the future (J. van der Meer, personal communication). A larger overlapping 10-Mb inversion<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> involving <italic>MSH2</italic> exons 1&#x2013;7 explained 60% of affected individuals in a cohort of suspected cryptic Lynch syndrome,<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr"><sup>62</sup></xref> and consequently that inversion is now being captured by MLPA testing (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S1</xref>).</p>
      <p id="p0350">The proband in Family 33, where a complex deletion and duplicated inversion was inherited from an unaffected mother, represents atypical (male) Rett syndrome. In contrast, the second <italic>MECP2</italic> family comprised an affected female, where classical Rett syndrome had long been suspected. In the second participant (Family 47), we found that a duplicated segment from 19qter had inserted into <italic>MECP2</italic>.

The major functional domain encoded by <italic>MECP2</italic> is the MBD, which involves residues 102&#x2013;174 (GenBank: NM_001110792.2; or 90&#x2013;162 on UniProt: <ext-link ext-link-type="UniProt" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/P51608" id="intref0210">P51608</ext-link>). To date, the reported truncating variants in affected males (non-mosaic) always lie after this domain. The earliest non-mosaic truncation to be described in a male individual that we are aware of is c.524_525del (p.Gly175Glufs<sup>&#x2217;</sup>11) (GenBank: NM_001110792.2), and that was associated with a very severe presentation, involving neonatal encephalopathy and bilateral polymicrogyria, and the individual died at 13&#xA0;months.<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr"><sup>64</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr"><sup>65</sup></xref> For Family 33, the alternative SV configuration would have led to an earlier truncation at codon 137 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>C) and hence would be expected to result in lethality for males. So a genuine germline truncation at p.Ile137 seems unlikely and may have led to a suspicion of mosaicism. In Family 47, the presence of a classical translocation would have altered how the family was counseled and determined which methods would be viable options for validation/cascade testing. Together with a similar case report,<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> our work poses the question of whether other unsolved individuals with Rett syndrome might be explained by cryptic SVs involving <italic>MECP2.</italic></p>
      <p id="p0355">Although the present study only aimed to identify inversions that disrupt the coding sequence of genes known to cause disease through HI, large SVs can also alter chromatin structure, which in turn can lead to changes in gene expression. A good example of this phenomenon from the 100kGP includes several families with complex duplication-inversions on chromosome 17 that create new topological-associated domains and result in a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa.<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> The bioinformatic filtering steps performed in our study meant that for most participants, the inversion breakpoints lay between coding exons. For this class of balanced inversion, the ACMG criteria PVS1<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> can typically be applied. However, there were notable exceptions to this rule. For the individual with craniosynostosis 1 (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="123100" id="intref0215">123100</ext-link>) and an inversion involving <italic>TWIST1</italic> (Family 24), the closest breakpoint lay 18 kb downstream of the disease-relevant gene, and so a position effect needs to be invoked. Pathogenicity was supported from a combination of co-segregation together with clinical specificity.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In the present study, this inversion was identified due to a longer overlapping transcript isoform (ENST00000443687.5) in the ENSEMBL v.105 annotation set. Similarly, the proximal breakpoint for the inversion involving <italic>HOXD11-13</italic> (Family 42) was exonic only for non-canonical <italic>HOXD13</italic> isoforms. This variant was supported by <italic>de novo</italic> occurrence, onward transmission to an affected son, and a high degree of clinical specificity. Several studies have investigated the chromatin domain boundaries at the <italic>HOXD</italic> locus.

A third exception was the complex SV in Family 44 involving interlinked duplications on 11p15.4. <italic>CDKN1C</italic> is a well-known locus for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome-associated rearrangements&#x2014;the first balanced rearrangements clustering 100-kb from <italic>CDKN1C</italic> were described nearly 30 years ago.<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> Our hypothesis is that this SV disrupts the maternal methylation status of the IC2 region, upregulating expression of <italic>KCNQ1OT1</italic> (MIM: 604115; KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1), and consequential repression of <italic>CDKN1C</italic>.

We note that a recent study describes a largely balanced chromothripsis event involving the <italic>APC</italic> locus as a germline cause of a colon cancer predisposition.<xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref> Although that rearrangement involved the translocation of ten fragments from 5q22.1q22.3 into 10q21.3 and showed a level of complexity similar to the rearrangement seen here, it was not a translocation in the classical sense and so would not have been identified by karyotyping. Other examples of cryptic <italic>APC</italic> variants are provided in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S6</xref>. Our results therefore strengthen the rationale that individuals with a strong clinical suspicion for a germline <italic>APC</italic> variant that remain unsolved following standard testing approaches should be considered for genome sequencing to uncover potential cryptic variants. The complex translocation identified here poses the related question of how often translocations uncovered by karyotyping have this degree of complexity. An earlier study found that 26% of balanced SVs detected by karyotyping involved three or more breakpoints.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0365">For 8/47 families, we are still not in touch with the recruiting clinician, despite repeated attempts to make contact over an &#x223C;18&#xA0;month period. Similar difficulties were also noted in a recent commentary, where a response rate of 20% was noted.<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> The reasons for this are often due to the time gap between recruitment and the research finding being uncovered (&gt;5 years for several participants). In that time an appreciable turnover of clinicians is to be expected. At the time of writing, 60% of these SVs reported here have been confirmed by an orthogonal approach. The validation results summarized in <xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#xA0;S2</xref> are intended to give a snapshot of an ongoing process. Our experience highlights variable levels of expertise and resources across different GLHs to perform validation, with many clinical laboratories having significant backlogs for validation of 100kGP findings considered non-urgent. Overall, validation efforts were split across research and clinical settings and involved a range of approaches. Once a complex SV is validated, interpretation also comes with difficulties. Although the ACMG/AMP variant classification guidelines have been adapted for single-gene CNVs,<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> clinical reporting guidelines currently do not cover complex SVs in detail.</p>
      <p id="p0370">Although exome sequencing can detect SVs in a small fraction of affected individuals,<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> the non-uniform coverage makes this approach non-optimal. For 100kGP participants who had previously been entered into the DDD study, retrospective analysis was only able to confirm SV breakpoints for 2/6 of these. We note that for the <italic>SOX5</italic> rearrangement (Family 6), exome data only captured the breakpoint for 1/6 reads, and so the SV would not have been called robustly without prior knowledge. Although the inversion disrupting <italic>DYRK1A</italic> (Family 36) was not captured by exome data due to breakpoints lying in intronic regions, a different inversion disrupting the same gene was identified in another individual from the DDD study as both breakpoints happened to lie in exonic regions.<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0375">For one of the two families with SVs involving <italic>ARID2</italic>, the SV was interpreted as an inversion at the time of initial review but was later considered more likely to be an integration of an S group subfamily Alu element. The pattern of read alignments was very similar to that seen for a putative inversion involving <italic>CASK</italic> (MIM: 300172), from a recent study using genome sequencing on 465 families with neurodevelopmental short-read data.<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref> In that study, the SV could not be confirmed by long-range PCR or by long-read genome sequencing, suggesting it to be a false positive. Other examples of complex SVs with incomplete interpretation are provided in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S7</xref>. In combination, these reports highlight that even with full genome sequencing data, careful scrutiny of read alignments is critical. Together with the initially ambiguous SVs involving <italic>MECP2</italic> described in Families 33 and 47, these data highlight that, where duplicated segments are involved, genome analysts should always consider whether other potential SV configurations could explain the short-read data. In situations where gene disruption (i.e., PVS1) cannot conclusively be inferred, additional testing is often needed to achieve diagnostic levels of certainty. The 681-bp duplicated segment found in Family 33 was not spanned by Illumina read pairs, and so clinical interpretation was uncertain until PacBio data were obtained (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>B). In contrast, a similar complex SV involving a 406-bp duplication in <italic>SCN5A</italic> (MIM: 600163), found in a participant from the 100kGP pilot study with suspected Brugada syndrome and who had remained unsolved from initial analysis,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> was resolved (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S30</xref>). The threshold for resolving duplicated segments in complex SVs using current Illumina 150-bp genome sequencing data is likely around 500&#xA0;bp. In contrast, we showed that for a proportion of individuals, the ability of long-read genome sequencing to span larger segments can help resolve complex SVs. The duplicated segment of 14.5 kb in Family 47 was able to be spanned using PacBio HiFi data, and this influenced how the SV was interpreted clinically. Due to limitations of current HiFi technology, segments of &gt;20 kb would be difficult to resolve, and other methods may need to be employed. We recently resolved a complex SV using a combination of simple RNA methods and Bionano optical genome mapping, the latter in which a high fraction of molecules &gt;500 kb were obtained.<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0380">Although the majority of variants described here were identified via bioinformatics prioritization steps, Families 23 and 40 were initially identified as a consequence of MDT review meetings, which led to manual scrutiny of read alignment data. In clinical laboratories with limited bioinformatics capabilities, this can be a fruitful way to reanalyze data from affected individuals where there is a strong clinical suspicion pointing to a specific gene. It is important that clinical laboratories gain extensive experience with complex variants to maximize the utility of whole-genome sequencing data, and some useful tips are provided in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Note S8</xref>.</p>
      <p id="p0385">In clinically accredited NGS laboratories, studies have shown that some classes of SNV/indel have such high accuracy that validation using an orthogonal approach is not essential for the variant to be reported.<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr"><sup>80</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr"><sup>81</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82</sup></xref> We speculate that the same will soon be true for SVs. Genome sequencing is the optimal approach to detect complex rearrangements, and so in our view, the failure of a poorly designed PCR-Sanger assay (or the inability to design suitable primers due to repeats) should ideally not delay reporting. At least two 100kGP participants were deceased before the results were able to be reported, making it hard to recontact families for appropriate follow-up. Also relevant to this discussion is one 100kGP participant (Family 15) harboring a <italic>de novo</italic> 1.22-Mb inversion that disrupts <italic>SATB2</italic> (MIM: 608148; GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:nucleotide" xlink:href="NM_001172509.2" id="intref0225">NM_001172509.2</ext-link>) in intron 2. This result was returned to the family before validation, on the basis of inspection in IGV (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#xA0;S31</xref>A and S31B) and a phenotype (absent speech, history of persistent drooling, and dental abnormalities that include a gap between the maxillary central incisors) that was felt to be a&#xA0;strong match with published cohorts of individuals with&#xA0;Glass syndrome (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="612313" id="intref0230">612313</ext-link>).<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> Future studies measuring specificity and sensitivity of SVs across large cohorts such as the one described here will shed light on whether validation is always necessary.</p>
      <p id="p0390">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that, although relatively rare in comparison with other classes of variant, genomic inversions play an important role across a range of RDs. As well as many instances where our findings end long diagnostic odysseys, several results impact immediately on clinical management. This is most notable for the subset of diagnoses involving tumor suppressor genes, where cascade testing and disease surveillance are now being implemented. In 30% of families, the disrupted gene had previously been nominated as a strong candidate gene, as evidenced by prior testing using targeted methods. The lengthy delays in obtaining a diagnosis (even after genome sequencing became available) are therefore notable, given that detection of complex SVs is a significant raison d&#x2019;&#xEA;tre for genome sequencing. Consequently, it is important that future clinical analysis pipelines in the NHS and in similar programs worldwide are adapted to prioritize these types of variant (in combination with better workflows for confirmation and reporting) as genome sequencing becomes commonplace. Critical to the success of this project was the development of the SVRare and a large database of SVs called in a consistent way that facilitated the aggregation and subsequent filtering steps to minimize the number of candidate variants that required manual review.</p>
