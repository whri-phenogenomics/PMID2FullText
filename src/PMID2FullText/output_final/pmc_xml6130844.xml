        <p id="P2">Human inborn errors of IFN-&#x3B3; immunity underlie mycobacterial diseases. We describe patients with BCG disease who are homozygous for loss-of-function mutations of <italic>SPPL2A</italic>. This gene encodes a transmembrane protease that degrades the N-terminal fragment (NTF) of CD74 (HLA invariant chain) in antigen-presenting cells. CD74 NTF therefore accumulates in the HLA class II<sup>+</sup> myeloid and lymphoid cells of SPPL2a-deficient patients. This toxic fragment selectively depletes IL-12- and IL-23-producing CD1c<sup>+</sup> conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s), and their circulating progenitors. Moreover, SPPL2a-deficient memory T<sub>H</sub>1* cells selectively fail to produce IFN-&#x3B3; when stimulated with mycobacterial antigens in vitro. Finally, <italic>Sppl2a</italic><sup>&#x2013;/&#x2013;</sup> mice lack cDC2s, have CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that produce small amounts of IFN-&#x3B3; upon BCG infection, and are highly susceptible to infection with BCG or <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. These findings suggest that inherited SPPL2a deficiency in humans underlies mycobacterial disease by decreasing the numbers of cDC2s and impairing IFN-&#x3B3; production by mycobacterium-specific memory T<sub>H</sub>1* cells.</p>

    <p id="P3">Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD, OMIM# 209950) is characterized by severe clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as BCG vaccines and environmental mycobacteria, in otherwise healthy individuals, typically without overt immunological anomalies and with normal resistance to most other infectious agents<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.

Allelic heterogeneity at four of these 10 loci (<italic>IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1, IL12RB1</italic>) has led to the description of 19 different genetic etiologies of MSMD<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.

The discovery that MSMD results from inborn errors of IFN-&#x3B3; immunity revealed the critical dependence of human anti-mycobacterial immunity on IFN-&#x3B3;. It also confirmed that IFN-&#x3B3; acts more as a macrophage-activating factor than as a classical interferon<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Moreover, the identification of MSMD patients with IL-12p40 or IL-12R&#x3B2;1 deficiency revealed a critical dependence on IL-12, IL-23, or both, for the production of sufficient levels of anti-mycobacterial IFN-&#x3B3;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, the genetic basis of this disease has remained elusive in almost half the MSMD patients studied in our laboratory. The cellular basis of MSMD also remains unknown. In particular, it remains unclear which human myeloid and lymphoid cells orchestrate the production of IFN-&#x3B3; for protective immunity to mycobacteria. In this context, we studied three patients with MSMD of unknown genetic etiology.</p>

        <title>Three MSMD patients with homozygous splice mutations of <italic>SPPL2A</italic></title>
        <p id="P4">We investigated three patients from two unrelated consanguineous families: a family from Morocco including two affected eight-year-old monozygotic twin sisters (P1 and P2, Kindred A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a family from Turkey including an affected 11-year-old boy (P3, Kindred B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). All three children suffered from BCG disease (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref> for clinical details). By combining whole-exome sequencing (WES) of P1 and P3 and genome-wide linkage (GWL) for both families, we identified a homozygous essential splice-site mutation in <italic>SPPL2A</italic> (encoding signal peptide peptidase-like 2A, SPPL2a) in each family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). There were no other relevant rare, non-synonymous or splice variants of protein-coding genes within the regions linked to MSMD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). Sanger sequencing confirmed that both P1 and P2 carried a homozygous c.733+1G&gt;A mutation of the splice donor site of <italic>SPPL2A</italic> intron 6, whereas P3 carried a homozygous c.1328-1G&gt;A mutation of the splice acceptor site of <italic>SPPL2A</italic> intron 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1b</xref>). The familial segregation of these mutations was consistent with an autosomal recessive (AR) trait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These mutations were not found in the gnomAD database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org</ext-link>) or our in-house database. The combined annotation dependent deletion (CADD) scores of 27.3 (c.733+1G&gt;A) and 26.4 (c.1328-1G&gt;A) obtained for these two alleles are well above the mutation significance cut-off (MSC)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> of 2.31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1c</xref>). Both family and population genetic studies, thus, strongly suggested that these three patients from two unrelated kindreds had autosomal recessive (AR) SPPL2a deficiency.</p>

        <title>Both <italic>SPPL2A</italic> mutations disrupt splicing of the full-length mRNA</title>
        <p id="P5">We assessed the functional consequences of these two variants for the splicing of <italic>SPPL2A</italic> mRNAs, by performing RT-PCR on mRNA from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B (EBV-B) cells of P1, Simian virus 40-transformed fibroblasts (SV40-Fibroblast) from P2, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of P3, and appropriate healthy controls both WT and heterozygous for the corresponding mutation. We amplified a segment spanning exons 4 to 7 for kindred A and exons 13 to 15 for kindred B. The cells from all patients yielded PCR products of lower molecular weight (MW) than those obtained for healthy controls, whereas those of heterozygous carriers yielded both products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Sanger sequencing of these PCR products showed that the c.733+1G&gt;A (P1 and P2) mutation was associated with the complete skipping of exon 6 in the encoded mRNA, whereas the c.1328-1G&gt;A (P3) mutation was associated with the complete skipping of exon 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Quantitative PCR showed that cells from the patients expressed about 25-40% the amount of <italic>SPPL2A</italic> mRNA found in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1d, e</xref>). This finding is consistent with nonsense-mediated mRNA decay due to a premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We then transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding a C-terminally V5-tagged WT protein or mutant <italic>SPPL2A</italic> cDNAs lacking exons 6 or 14 (&#x394;ex6 or &#x394;ex14, respectively). Immunoblotting with an antibody (Ab) against amino acids 196-210 (a region preserved partially in &#x394;ex6 and completely in &#x394;ex14 SPPL2a proteins) revealed a protein product with an apparent MW between 76 and 102 kDa for the WT construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We detected no &#x394;ex6 SPPL2a protein and a protein of approximately 52 kDa for &#x394;ex14 SPPL2a, consistent with the predicted MW of the truncated protein (50 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Immunoblotting with an Ab against the C-terminal V5 tag showed both mutant proteins to be absent. These results indicate that both <italic>SPPL2A</italic> mutations disrupt mRNA splicing and lead to a loss of SPPL2a protein production (for the c.733+1G&gt;A mutation causing &#x394;ex6) or to the production of a truncated protein (the c.1328-1G&gt;A mutation causing &#x394;ex14) in an overexpression system. These findings strongly suggested that the patients had AR complete SPPL2a deficiency.</p>

        <title>Accumulation of the N-terminal fragment of CD74 in SPPL2a-deficient cell lines</title>

The mutations of our patients resulted in the intracellular expression of TNF by a lower percentage of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but this had no effect on overall TNF secretion <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1g, h</xref>). Normal amounts of secreted TNF are consistent with both SPPL2a cleaving the TNF NTF after its soluble segment has been released and the redundant function of SPPL2a and SPPL2b in that cleavage<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. We then considered CD74, the only substrate of SPPL2a to have been confirmed in conditions of constitutive expression<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. CD74 is expressed by HLA class II<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells (APC)<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), CD74 forms a heterotrimer with HLA class II &#x3B1; and &#x3B2; chains via the class II invariant chain peptide (CLIP) region. CD74 is transported to the endosomal compartments, where it is processed by four successive proteolytic cleavages, leaving the CLIP fragment associated with the HLA class II molecule and a standalone membrane-bound NTF. In the final step of CD74 processing, SPPL2a mediates the intramembrane cleavage of the NTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. We evaluated the functional consequences of SPPL2a deficiency in patients, by assessing CD74 NTF accumulation in various cell types ex vivo and in cell lines in vitro<italic>,</italic> with a Ab recognizing the amino acids 12-28 in the N-terminal of human CD74. We found that CD74 NTF levels were much higher in EBV-B cells from P1, IFN-&#x3B3; stimulated SV40-Fibroblasts from P2, and PBMCs from P3, than in the corresponding cells from healthy donors and <italic>SPPL2A</italic>-heterozygous relatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). We used a retroviral system to introduce the WT <italic>SPPL2A</italic> allele into EBV-B cells from P1; this rescued the phenotype of CD74 NTF accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We also tested all eight <italic>SPPL2A</italic> variants found in the homozygous state in public databases and found that all of these variants rescued CD74 NTF accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). Moreover, the addition of the inhibitors of SPPL2a function L-685,458 and (Z-LL)<sub>2</sub>-ketone, led to the accumulation of CD74 NTF in EBV-B cells from healthy individuals, albeit to a lower extent than in SPPL2a-deficient EBV-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). No CD74 NTF accumulation was observed with another inhibitor (DAPT) with no inhibitory effects on SPPL2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). As previously reported, inhibitors of cathepsin (E64d) stabilized larger intermediates of CD74 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. These results confirmed the complete functional deficiency of SPPL2a, in terms of CD74 NTF cleavage, in the three patients. They also demonstrated that the frequency of SPPL2a deficiency in the general population is well below that of MSMD (about 10<sup>&#x2013;5</sup>). Collectively, these findings showed that the two <italic>SPPL2A</italic> mutations underlie AR SPPL2a deficiency in these two kindreds.</p>

        <title>Accumulation of CD74 NTF in SPPL2a-deficient leukocytes</title>
        <p id="P7">We further analyzed the cell type-specific impact of SPPL2a-dependent CD74 NTF accumulation. We first determined by flow cytometry the intracellular CD74 levels in primary monocytes, B, and T cells. We observed that intracellular CD74 staining was stronger in monocytes and B cells from SPPL2a-deficient patients than in those of healthy controls and heterozygous relatives, whereas no such difference was observed for T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2a,b</xref>). This stronger staining presumably reflects the accumulation of NTF observed on immunoblots of EBV-B cells, PBMCs, and SV40-Fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We then measure cell surface CD74 expression on these same leukocyte subsets, with an Ab against the extracellular domain of CD74. CD74 expression on the surface of monocytes, B cells, and T cells did not differ significantly between SPPL2a-deficient patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2a,c</xref>). We then identified the leukocyte subsets with the highest amounts of CD74 NTF accumulation, by treating PBMCs from healthy controls with L-685,458, an inhibitor of SPPL2a. The CD1c<sup>+</sup> subset of circulating conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) accumulated the highest amount of CD74 NTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2d</xref>). Circulating CD141<sup>+</sup>Clec9a<sup>+</sup> conventional DCs (cDC1s), CD303<sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and B cells had intermediate levels of CD74 NTF accumulation following drug treatment, whereas no accumulation was detectable in monocytes, NK and T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2d</xref>). Thus, in the context of abolished SPPL2a function, CD74 NTF accumulates in various types of human HLA class II<sup>+</sup> APCs, the highest amounts being reached in cDC2s. Moreover, MSMD patients with autosomal dominant (AD) IRF8 deficiency have no cDC2s<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p>

P3 had normal specific Ab titers against vaccine antigens and mounted specific Ab responses following infection with viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). Following inoculation of conjugated pneumococcal vaccines, the three patients mounted normal Ab responses against some, but not all, serotypes of pneumococcal glycans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>).

Total cDC (CD11c<sup>+</sup>) frequencies were also lower in the patients than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). These results suggest that humans with AR SPPL2a deficiency have a selective loss of cDC2s. The remaining CD1c<sup>+</sup> cells in the patients also displayed elevated HLA-DR expression at the cell surface than controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4c,d</xref>), as previously shown in <italic>Sppla2</italic><sup>&#x2013;/&#x2013;</sup> mice<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. CD74 NTF-mediated toxicity probably triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress sensor XBP1 expression, which is an inducer of MHC II expression<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Strikingly, the selective cDC2-deficiency phenotype of these patients resembles that previously observed in the two MSMD patients with AD partial IRF8 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-c</xref>)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. However, an analysis of cDC1s within the CD11c<sup>+</sup> gate, using CD141 and Clec9a Abs, showed that the DC defect of these patients was not restricted to cDC2s. Instead of the two populations seen in healthy controls, the patients had just one Clec9a<sup>&#x2013;</sup> population with abnormally high CD141 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4a</xref>). The lower frequency of CD1c<sup>hi</sup> cDC2s observed in both AR SPPL2a-deficient and AD IRF8-deficient patients was not due to low CD1c expression, as the CD1c<sup>&#x2013;</sup> DC population of both healthy controls and SPPL2a or IRF8-deficient patients contained no HLA-DR<sup>hi</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup> cells, these two markers being characteristics of cDC2s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4e</xref>). In addition, by contrast to the very high plasma concentrations of Flt3 ligand found in patients with AD GATA2 deficiency and AR IRF8 complete deficiency, who lack multiple types of circulating DC<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, patients with AD IRF8 and AR SPPL2a deficiency have normal circulating Flt3 ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4f</xref>). As cDC2s are potent producers of IL-12 and IL-23<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, we tested the capacity of these patients to produce IL-12p40, a subunit common to these two cytokines<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. We stimulated whole blood from healthy controls and SPPL2a-deficient patients with BCG, IFN-&#x3B3;, or both, and measured IL-12p40 production. We observed no defect of IL-12p40 production in patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency, suggesting that the low frequency of cDC2s in these patients does not cause an overt IL-12 and IL-23 defect in the stimulation conditions used<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4g</xref>). Collectively, these data indicated that patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency had a defect of the cDC2 compartment that did not prevent their whole blood from producing IL-12p40 in response to BCG and IFN-&#x3B3;.</p>

This suggests that SPPL2a deficiency impedes DC development at the pre-DC stage, when HLA-DR expression is initiated.

However, the increase in intracellular CD74 relative to untreated cells was larger in cDC2s than in the other subsets analyzed, demonstrating that NTF accumulation was due to the inhibition of SPPL2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). These data suggested that residual SPPL2a activity in the presence of the inhibitor might be sufficient for the development of cDC2s in vitro, but not in patients with the corresponding null genetic defect in vivo<italic>.</italic> Our data indicated that the chemical inhibition of SPPL2a in peripheral leukocytes from healthy donors ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) and during DC differentiation from peripheral stem cells in vitro resulted in the preferential accumulation of CD74 NTF in cDC2. Moreover, the frequency of DC progenitors was low in SPPL2a-deficient patients from the first stages of HLA-II expression, consistent with the role of CD74 in correct HLA-II complex assembly. These findings strongly suggested that the mechanism underlying the paucity of cDC2 cells in SPPL2a-deficient patients involved CD74 NTF toxicity, as proven in the mouse model<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p>

However, given the very low frequency of circulating cDC2s, we hypothesized that the cytokine production capacity of SPPL2a-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells might be impaired due to a defect of the differentiation of naive cells into memory cells in vivo.

No impairment in the polarization capacity was observed by measuring the increase in IFN-&#x3B3;, IL-10, or IL-17F production between naive and polarized T<sub>H</sub> cells, suggesting that T<sub>H</sub>-cell function is not globally impaired in patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Given the similarities between AR SPPL2a and AD IRF8 deficiencies, we analyzed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function in a patient with AD IRF8 deficiency in a similar manner. No impairment of IFN-&#x3B3;, IL-13, and IL-17A production relative to healthy controls was observed for the patient&#x2019;s CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that their polarization capacities were also intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).

The T cell lines were then analyzed for reactivity to viral, bacterial, and fungal antigens presented by autologous irradiated B cells, as measured by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation. The frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells reacting with antigens from BCG or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) were similar in healthy controls and patients with SPPL2a deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). By contrast, BCG- or MTB-specific cells were less frequent or absent in patients with AD IRF8 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). SPPL2a-deficient patients had a high frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>&#x2013;</sup> T cells against viral antigens (CMV, EBV, Flu, RSV), whereas the frequency of these cells was variable in healthy donors and IRF8-deficient patients, possibly reflecting differences in exposure or vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6g</xref>). Notably, in patients with SPPL2a deficiency, IFN-&#x3B3; production was much weaker in CD4<sup>+</sup> CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to BCG or MTB antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>), whereas IFN-&#x3B3; production by T cells responding to viral antigens was similar to that of healthy donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).

These data suggested that SPPL2a-deficient patients displayed a mycobacterium-specific IFN-&#x3B3; production defect by memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We confirmed that the responding T cell lines were actually T<sub>H</sub>1* cells expressing the characteristic CCR4, CXCR3, and CCR6 markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6j</xref>). The few mycobacterium-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with AD IRF8 deficiency also displayed low IFN-&#x3B3; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>).

This is consistent with the study of ex vivo cytokine production by CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells described above. The strong accumulation of CD74 NTF in the B cells used might affect their capacity to act as APCs. We thus pulsed EBV-B cells from P1, non-transduced or transduced with a retrovirus generated with an empty vector or a wild-type <italic>SPPL2A</italic> cDNA, with MTB peptides (which do not require processing) or whole MTB antigens (which require processing), using them as APCs to stimulate MTB-specific T cell clones from P1 and P2.

Similar results were obtained when Flu vaccine was used to stimulate Flu-specific T cell clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6k</xref>).

      <p id="P15">We describe here AR complete SPPL2a deficiency, as a genetic etiology of MSMD. We also show that <italic>Sppl2a</italic><sup>&#x2013;/&#x2013;</sup> mice are susceptible to BCG and MTB. Impaired SPPL2a activity, whether genetic or pharmacological in origin, causes CD74 NTF to accumulate in H-2 and HLA class II<sup>+</sup> APCs in mice and humans, respectively. This accumulation leads to a profound B cell deficiency in <italic>Sppl2a</italic><sup>&#x2013;/&#x2013;</sup> mice<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> but not in SPPL2a-deficient humans. By contrast, both mice and humans with SPPL2a deficiency have a profound defect of the cDC2 compartment. This myeloid phenotype is due to CD74 NTF accumulation, as NTF levels in cDC2s are highest after the pharmacological inhibition of SPPL2a in healthy donor cells. Moreover, circulating pre-DC progenitors have a low abundance in SPPL2a-deficient patients, from the first stage of HLA-class II expression. Finally, the cDC2 deficiency is rescued in vivo by the genetic ablation of CD74 in <italic>Sppl2a</italic><sup>&#x2013;/&#x2013;</sup> mice<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. A complete lack of the three main circulating DC subsets (cDC1s, cDC2s, and pDCs) has been observed in patients with AD GATA2 or AR IRF8 deficiency, both of which cause mycobacterial disease and other infections<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. AD IRF8 deficiency, a genetic etiology of MSMD, was thought to cause an isolated defect of circulating CD1c<sup>+</sup> cDC2 cells<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. However, our present, detailed analysis revealed that both types of conventional DCs &#x2014; cDC1s and cDC2s &#x2014; are actually affected in these patients. By contrast, AR SPPL2a deficiency results in an isolated cDC2 defect, highlighting the crucial role of this human DC population in anti-mycobacterial immunity.</p>
      <p id="P16">We also found that patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency have a profound defect of mycobacterium-specific IFN-&#x3B3; production by the CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells of the T<sub>H</sub>1* subset. Paradoxically, T<sub>H</sub>1* cell counts were normal in the blood of these patients, and these cells proliferated normally in response to mycobacterial antigens, and produced IFN-&#x3B3; upon polyclonal mitogenic stimulation in vitro. Moreover, our study shows that patients with AD IRF8 deficiency also have a more severe memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell defect, with poor proliferation of T<sub>H</sub>1* cells in response to mycobacterial antigens in vitro. Nevertheless, the clinical phenotype of MSMD is identical in patients with these two deficiencies. Despite some immunological differences between AR SPPL2a-deficient patients and AD IRF8-deficient patients, these two genetic diseases share three core phenotypes: a defect of cDC2, a defect of mycobacterium-specific T<sub>H</sub>1* cells, and a clinical phenotype of MSMD. These findings suggest that cDC2 and T<sub>H</sub>1* cells play an essential role in human anti-mycobacterial immunity. The link between these two disorders is highlighted by the observation that transcription of the mouse <italic>Sppl2a</italic> gene is controlled by various transcription factors including IRF8. We also found that SPPL2a levels were slightly lower than normal in EBV-B cells with complete IRF8 deficiency. IRF8 is probably more critical for the expression of SPPL2a in DCs. However, these cells are lacking in patients with either AR or AD IRF8 deficiency, making it impossible to assess SPPL2a expression in IRF8-deficient myeloid cells.</p>
      <p id="P17">Our findings suggest that cDC2s may be the key cells presenting mycobacterial peptide antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The cDC2 deficiency in patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency might cause defective priming in mycobacterium-specific T<sub>H</sub>1* cells. The normally high IL-12 and IL-23 production by cDC2 cells are probably relevant<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Indeed, AR deficiencies of IL-12p40 or IL-12R&#x3B2;1 underlie MSMD<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Defective IL-12 and IL-23 stimulation in the course of T cell priming might prevent the correct development of T<sub>H</sub>1* cells in patients with AR SPPL2a deficiency. Overall, our findings suggest that cDC2s are required in vivo for T<sub>H</sub>1* priming following the presentation of mycobacterial antigens. There is probably a causal relationship between the global cDC2 and narrow T<sub>H</sub>1* phenotypes in these patients, given the multiple known relationships between the cells involved (DC and T<sub>H</sub>) and their relevant products (IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-&#x3B3;). The myeloid and lymphoid phenotypes are both broader in patients with IRF8 deficiency than in those with SPPL2a deficiency, providing further support for a connection. The core myeloid phenotype, with a global cDC2/IL-12-23 defect, or the core lymphoid phenotype, with a mycobacterium-specific T<sub>H</sub>1*/IFN-&#x3B3; defect, or both, might also cause a clinical phenotype of MSMD in other patients<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.

        <p id="P18">Two of the patients studied (P1 and P2) are twins born in 2009 to first-cousin Moroccan parents. They were vaccinated with BCG at birth and presented with unilaterally enlarged and inflammatory axillary lymph nodes at nine months of age. The enlarged lymph nodes were surgically removed. Biopsy confirmed the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB), consistent with mycobacterial infection. P1 and P2 had normal counts of neutrophils, monocytes, CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells, CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. No immunoglobulin, respiratory burst or complement defects were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). No complications had been observed during the pregnancy, but neonatal asphyxiation was noted during the delivery. MSMD was subsequently diagnosed. Neither of the patients presented any other episodes of mycobacterial infection by the time of clinical evaluation at three years of age. In addition to MSMD, the patients displayed hereditary spastic paraplegia due to a homozygous p.R1105X mutation of the <italic>AP4E1</italic> gene<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p>
        <p id="P19">P3 is a boy born to first-degree consanguineous parents in Turkey in 2007. He presented with a two-month history of left axillary lymphadenopathy. He was vaccinated with BCG, on the left shoulder, at the age of two months. At the age of six months, he was treated with isoniazid after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) (22 x 22 mm), possibly due to contact with his aunt, who had active pulmonary TB. He had a normal thoracic computed tomography scan at the time. His parents and brother are healthy. His aunt, grandfather, great uncle and great aunt had suffered from pulmonary TB. Physical examination was unremarkable, with the exception of an enlarged lymph node (3x3 cm) in the left axillary region. Leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count and absolute lymphocyte count were normal. Serum IgG level was low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), whereas serum IgA, IgM and IgE levels were normal for age. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were normal. Neutrophil function in the neutrophil oxidative burst assay (DHR) was normal. CD212 (IL-12R&#x3B2;1) expression was normal (CD212: 83%, control: &gt;80%) on the surface of activated T cells. The tuberculin skin test (TST) was positive (10&#xD7;10 mm). The enlarged axillary lymph node was excised and dissected. Large amounts of calcified material were drained from the lymph node during dissection. Histological examination revealed a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Ziehl-Neelsen staining revealed the presence of AFB. MTB complex PCR and culture were negative. MSMD was diagnosed and anti-mycobacterial tritherapy was initiated. P3 is now 11 years old and remains free from mycobacterial disease and other infectious diseases.</p>

The CCR6<sup>+</sup> subset, including T cells producing IL-17 and IFN-&#x3B3;, and the CCR6<sup>&#x2013;</sup> subset, including T cells producing IL-4 and IFN-&#x3B3;, were collected<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, 1% (vol/vol) sodium pyruvate, penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 &#x3BC;g/ml) (all from Invitrogen) and 5% heat-inactivated human serum (Swiss RedCross). The sorted memory T cells (500 cells/well) were stimulated polyclonally with 1 &#x3BC;g/ml PHA (Remel) in the presence of irradiated (45 Gy) allogeneic feeder cells (2.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> per well) and IL-2 (500 IU/ml), in a 96-well plate, and cell lines were expanded, as previously described<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Library screening was performed 14-21 days after initial stimulation, by culturing thoroughly washed T cells (2.5x10<sup>5</sup>/well) with autologous irradiated B cells (2.5x10<sup>4</sup>), with or without a three-hour pulse of various antigens, including the CMV/EBV HLA class II peptide pool or the EBV HLA class II peptide pool (0.5 &#x3BC;g/ml/peptide, comprising 122 peptides (46 EBV and 76 CMV)), the MTB epitope pool (0.5 &#x3BC;g/ml/peptide, comprising 207 peptides), the BCG epitope pool (0.5 &#x3BC;g/ml/peptide, comprising 211 peptides), purified RSV A-2-containing lysate (100 &#xB5;g/ml, Advanced Biotechnologies), influenza virus vaccine (Crucell) or <italic>Candida albicans</italic>-containing lysate (used at 5 &#x3BC;g/ml). Multiepitope peptide pools were prepared as previously described<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>. Proliferation was assessed on day 4, after incubation for 16 h with 1 &#x3BC;Ci/ml [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine (GE Healthcare). Precursor frequencies were calculated from the number of negative wells, assuming a Poisson distribution, and are expressed per million cells<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Cytokine concentrations in positive culture supernatants were determined after 48 hours of stimulation with cytometric bead arrays (BioLegend). T cell clones were made by sorting ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells from antigen-stimulated T cell lines and plating them at 0.5 cells per well in 384 well plates in IL-2 complete media with 1 &#x3BC;g/ml PHA (Remel), and 50,000 irradiated allogenous PBMC per well. T cell clones were stained for FACS analysis and used in proliferation assays to assess antigen-presenting function of EBV-B cells from SPPL2A-deficient patient transduced with a retrovirus generated with a WT allele of <italic>SPPL2A</italic> or an empty vector gene as described avobe.</p>

          <p id="P38">Mice (C57BL6/J) were killed and their spleens were removed and placed in cold RPMI supplemented with 3% FBS and 2% P/S. Single-cell suspensions were prepared and red blood cells were lysed in lysis buffer (155 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 12 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA). Cells were washed and plated at a density of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate for cell staining in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS). Viable cells were stained with Aqua Zombie Fixable Viability Dye (BioLegend) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were surface-stained for 30 minutes at 4&#xB0;C with the following Ab cocktail for DCs: anti-CD45 APC/eFluor 780 (47-0451-80, 30-F11, eBioscience), anti-CD11b PE-Cy7 (101215, M1/70, BioLegend), anti-CD11c PerCP/Cy5.5 (117327, N418, BioLegend), anti-CD8 eFluor (100707, 53-6.7, BioLegend), anti-CD49b PE (108907, DX5, BioLegend), anti-CD19 PE (152407, 1D3, BioLegend), anti-TCR&#x3B2; PE (109207, H57-597, BioLegend), anti-Ly6G PE (127607, 1A8, BioLegend), anti-TCR&#x3B3;&#x3B4; PE (118107, GL3, BioLegend). Cells were fixed and sorted with an eight-color FACS Canto II machine equipped with FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). The data obtained were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). In total, 10<sup>5</sup> cells were acquired and aggregates were removed on the basis of forward scatter height (FSC-H) vs. area (FSC-A). Debris removal was evaluated by assessing side scatter area (SSC-A) and FSC-A. Viable cells were identified by gating on the population negative for Aqua Zombie viability dye (V500), and leukocytes were isolated as CD45<sup>+</sup> cells. All Abs were obtained from eBioscience unless otherwise stated.</p>

          <p id="P41">We infected 8- to 12-week-old mice with an aerosol of ~50 CFU of MTB H37Rv and monitored survival. Infectious dose was determined by the replication of colony-forming units (CFU) from total lung homogenates. In a separate experiment, we infected 8- to 12-week-old mice with an aerosol of ~50 CFU of MTB H37Rv and killed them 30 and 60 post-infection. Bacterial loads at these time points were determined by the replication of colony-forming units from lung homogenates. Immunophenotyping analysis was performed on the lungs, with single-cell suspensions generated by mechanical disruption and collagenase A digestion. Single cells from the lungs and spleen were processed as described above.</p>
