      <abstract>
        <p>Platelets are anuclear cells that are essential for blood clotting. They are produced by large polyploid precursor cells called megakaryocytes. Previous genome-wide association studies in nearly 70,000 individuals indicated that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the gene encoding the actin cytoskeletal regulator tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) exert an effect on the count and volume of platelets. Platelet number and volume are independent risk factors for heart attack and stroke. Here, we have identified 2 unrelated families in the BRIDGE Bleeding and Platelet Disorders (BPD) collection who carry a <italic>TPM4</italic> variant that causes truncation of the TPM4 protein and segregates with macrothrombocytopenia, a disorder characterized by low platelet count. <italic>N</italic>-Ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea&#x2013;induced (ENU-induced) missense mutations in <italic>Tpm4</italic> or targeted inactivation of the <italic>Tpm4</italic> locus led to gene dosage&#x2013;dependent macrothrombocytopenia in mice. All other blood cell counts in <italic>Tpm4</italic>-deficient mice were normal. Insufficient TPM4 expression in human and mouse megakaryocytes resulted in a defect in the terminal stages of platelet production and had a mild effect on platelet function. Together, our findings demonstrate a nonredundant role for <italic>TPM4</italic> in platelet biogenesis in humans and mice and reveal that truncating variants in <italic>TPM4</italic> cause a previously undescribed dominant Mendelian platelet disorder.</p>

Megakaryocytes undergo a unique process of growth and maturation involving replication of DNA without cell division (endomitosis), a massive expansion of cytoplasmic volume, and the development of an extensive internal membranous network known as the demarcation membrane system. Upon maturity, megakaryocytes form filamentous protrusions termed &#x201C;proplatelets&#x201D; that are extruded into the bone marrow sinusoids. Evidence suggests platelet biogenesis is the result of individual platelets budding off from proplatelets, as well as proplatelets themselves being shed and subsequently maturing into platelets within the circulation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The molecular regulation of this unique process of blood cell formation is only partially understood.</p>
      <p>The number, cellular volume, and function of platelets are tightly regulated within individuals. However, all 3 parameters vary widely at the population level, and represent independent risk factors for heart attack and stroke (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Population variation is to a large extent explained by common single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which exert small effects. Major deviations are triggered by rare variants that have effects of sufficient magnitude to cause Mendelian platelet disorders. A metaanalysis of genome-wide association studies identified 68 independent common SNVs associated with platelet count and volume (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Several of these SNVs were linked to genes encoding proteins with well-established roles in platelet formation (e.g., <italic>THPO</italic> [thrombopoietin], <italic>GP1BA</italic> [glycoprotein Ib&#x3B1;], <italic>TUBB1</italic> [tubulin-&#x3B2;1]) and survival (the apoptosis regulator <italic>BAK</italic> [encoding BAK]). However, the vast majority of identified SNVs were located near genes hitherto uncharacterized in the megakaryocyte lineage.</p>
      <p>Tropomyosins, which form copolymers with actin, are a prime example, with SNVs rs3809566 and rs8109288 marking the genes encoding tropomyosin 1 (<italic>TPM1</italic>) and tropomyosin 4 (<italic>TPM4</italic>), respectively. It has been reported that expression of transcripts from the <italic>TPM4</italic> locus strongly increases in the later stages of megakaryopoiesis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation in primary megakaryocytes for 5 transcription factors with essential roles in platelet biogenesis revealed that <italic>TPM4</italic> contains a nucleosome-depleted regulatory element occupied by all 5 factors (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), placing the gene in a unique category of fewer than 200 genes. Morpholino knockdown of its homolog <italic>tpma</italic> in zebrafish abolished the formation of thrombocytes, suggesting a functional role for <italic>TPM4</italic> in mammalian thrombopoiesis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>Tropomyosins are ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved. Mouse and human homologs exhibit greater than 90% identity at the amino acid level. In mammals, tropomyosins are encoded by 4 different genes: <italic>TPM1</italic>, <italic>TPM2</italic>, <italic>TPM3</italic>, and <italic>TPM4</italic>. Alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing result in approximately 40 different TPM protein isoforms in humans (reviewed in ref. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>; for nomenclature used in this study, see ref. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Intriguingly, despite their similarity, individual tropomyosin genes have largely nonredundant functions, as illustrated by the fact that the constitutive deletion of either <italic>Tpm1</italic>, <italic>Tpm2</italic>, or <italic>Tpm3</italic> in mice results in embryonic lethality (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). <italic>Tpm4</italic> knockout mice have not previously been described.</p>
      <p>The best-characterized tropomyosins are the muscle-specific isoforms, which mediate the interaction between myosin and actin. In humans, mutations affecting the expression of muscle tropomyosins cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<italic>TPM1</italic>) and nemaline myopathies (<italic>TPM2</italic> and <italic>TPM3</italic>). These disease phenotypes are recapitulated in mice carrying similar mutations (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The &#x201C;nonmuscle&#x201D; (or &#x201C;cytoskeletal&#x201D;) tropomyosin isoforms are often referred to as &#x201C;gatekeepers,&#x201D; as they regulate the accession of other actin-binding proteins and myosin motors to the actin filament (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The cytoskeletal tropomyosins are implicated in the regulation of cell morphology, adhesion, migration, granule trafficking, cell division, and apoptosis. Except for an involvement in modulating erythrocyte membrane stability (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), virtually nothing is known about the roles of tropomyosins in hematopoietic cells.</p>
      <p>Here, we demonstrate that, in both humans and mice, TPM4 is an essential mediator of platelet biogenesis. Genome sequencing of 865 index cases with bleeding and platelet disorders of unknown molecular etiology revealed 2 pedigrees with a premature stop codon in <italic>TPM4</italic>. This variant was absent from nearly 75,000 control DNA samples and segregated with large platelets and concomitant low platelet count (a phenotype termed macrothrombocytopenia) in the 2 pedigrees. Mutation of murine <italic>Tpm4</italic> resulted in dose-dependent macrothrombocytopenia caused by a defect in the terminal stages of platelet production. This was recapitulated by shRNA knockdown in human megakaryocytes. In addition to a reduction in platelet number and an increase in mean platelet volume, a mild defect in platelet function was observed in both humans and mice. Our findings demonstrate that <italic>TPM4</italic> encodes a tropomyosin with an important nonredundant role in platelet biogenesis, and define a novel, dominant, Mendelian platelet disorder.</p>

        <p>Previous RNA sequencing studies have indicated that human megakaryocytes express <italic>TPM1</italic>, <italic>TPM3</italic>, and <italic>TPM4</italic>, and low levels of <italic>TPM2</italic> (ref. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI86154DS1).">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI86154DS1).</ext-link> We performed reverse transcriptase&#x2013;PCR (RT-PCR), which confirmed these findings, and demonstrated that <italic>TPM4</italic> is the most highly expressed of the tropomyosins, followed by <italic>TPM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Western blotting of whole cell lysates demonstrated the presence of protein products of all 4 tropomyosin genes in WT mouse and healthy human control platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The short TPM4 30-kDa isoform (TPM4.2) was the major isoform in both species. Human platelets additionally appear to harbor small amounts of the long 38-kDa TPM4.1 isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). Hereafter, the term &#x201C;TPM4&#x201D; is used to indicate both protein isoforms TPM4.1 and TPM4.2 (in humans) or solely TPM4.2 (in mice).</p>

        <p>We next performed a look-up in the database for the Biomedical Research Centres/Units Inherited Diseases Genetic Evaluation (BRIDGE) Bleeding and Platelet Disorders (BPD) collection. To date, over 1,000 participants have been enrolled and genome-sequenced as part of the BRIDGE-BPD study for genome sequencing along with approximately 5,000 participants with other rare diseases enrolled to the NIHR BioResource&#x2013;Rare Diseases (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Two high-impact rare variants in <italic>TPM4.1</italic> and 1 in <italic>TPM4.2</italic> were identified. The variant affecting the product of <italic>TPM4.2</italic> was a nucleotide substitution of C to T at position 16192795 of chromosome 19 (build GRCh37). It was present on 1 allele in 2 unrelated BPD cases and was absent from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) as well as the UK10K database (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The 2 cases do not share any other rare variants, and their estimated genome-wide kinship, based on common unlinked SNVs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), was estimated to be zero, suggesting that the variant did not arise in a recent common ancestor.</p>
        <p>Predicted loss-of-function variants in TPM4.2 are rare in the general population, with only 2 heterozygotes observed among the more than 60,000 individuals in ExAC (1 with a splice site variant and 1 with a variant encoding a premature stop at residue 54). The variant concerning the BPD patients encodes a premature stop codon in exon 3 of <italic>TPM4</italic>, resulting in a truncation at residue 69 of the major protein isoform TPM4.2, and residue 105 of the minor isoform TPM4.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Macrothrombocytopenia was deemed present if the platelet count was below 150 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter or the mean platelet volume above 13 fl or if there was presence of macrothrombocytes as observed by electron microscopy. The propositus of pedigree 1 carrying the premature stop codon was a woman of mixed European descent who was enrolled to the BRIDGE-BPD study at 56 years old with a history of mild bleeding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Methods</xref> for full clinical history) consistent with observed platelet counts in the range of 80 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> to 110 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter. Other than breast carcinoma, there was no other relevant past medical history. Analysis of 2 siblings and the propositus&#x2019; daughter demonstrated segregation of the observed variant with macrothrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>). The propositus (1-II-5) and her daughter (1-III-7) exhibited platelet counts lower than those of the unaffected siblings (103 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 140 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter compared with 226 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> and 236 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter, respectively) with mean platelet volumes well above 13 fl. All other blood counts were within normal range (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting a specific role for TPM4 in the megakaryocyte lineage.</p>
        <p>The propositus of pedigree 2 was a woman of mixed European descent enrolled in the BRIDGE-BPD study at 58 years of age. She had a platelet count of 230 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter with a platelet volume near the upper limit of normal (12.9 fl). Macrothrombocytes were observed by electron microscopy. She had suffered with menorrhagia from menarche that did not improve upon hormonal therapy and therefore required recurrent dilatation and curettages, and finally a hysterectomy at the age of 37 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Methods</xref> for full clinical history). Platelet function tests including von Willebrand parameters and coagulation factors (IX, XI, and XIII) revealed no abnormality. Other than severe asthma and eczema, there was no past medical history of note. Analysis of 3 of the propositus&#x2019; children demonstrated segregation of the observed variant with a lower platelet count and larger platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). Pedigree member 2-III-5, who carries the variant, had a platelet count and mean platelet volume just within the normal range (160 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter and 12.3 fl, respectively). He experienced no abnormal bleeding in response to a number of hemostatic challenges, including a laparotomy, orchiopexy, and 4 dental extractions. His sibling (2-III-7), who also carries the mutation, exhibited a low platelet count (146 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter) and large mean platelet volume (14.6 fl), and a bleeding tendency similar to the propositus&#x2019; (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Methods</xref> for full clinical history). 2-III-6 does not carry the variant and had the highest platelet count (278 &#xD7; 10<sup>9</sup> per liter) and lowest mean platelet volume (10.8 fl) of all family members. Thus, the variant cosegregates with isolated macrothrombocytopenia.</p>
        <p><italic>TPM4.2</italic> mRNA levels were reduced to 59% and 78% of the control in the affected cases 1-II-5 and 1-III-7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), and a corresponding approximately 50% reduction in the expression of TPM4.2 protein was observed with an antibody raised against the TPM4 C-terminus (&#x3B4;/9d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Pedigree 2 exhibited similar defects, with mRNA levels reduced to 46%&#x2013;63%, and we were able to detect a corresponding reduction in TPM4.2 protein in 2 of 3 affected pedigree members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 1D</xref>). The sex-stratified quantiles of mean platelet volume measurements with respect to the INTERVAL study (measurements obtained using a Sysmex hematology analyzer from 48,345 blood donors) were all above 91%, with 3 of the 5 measurements at percentiles exceeding 99.9% (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). This indicates that the platelets of the carriers are consistently large, with some extremely large. The sex-stratified quantiles of the platelet count (PLT) measurements with respect to INTERVAL were below 4% in all cases except the index case of pedigree 2, with 3 of the 5 measurements at percentiles below 1%. In contrast, all the WT homozygotes had PLT quantiles between 23% and 82% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The probability of observing cosegregation under the null hypothesis that the mutant is not causal, conditional on having already observed the mutant in the propositi, is 0.5<sup>3</sup> for each pedigree, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0156 in total. Collectively, these data provide convincing evidence that loss-of-function variants in <italic>TPM4</italic> can cause macrothrombocytopenia, and suggest it plays a role in the development of the megakaryocyte lineage.</p>

        <title>A loss-of-function allele of murine Tpm4 causes macrothrombocytopenia.</title>
        <p>In parallel studies, we conducted an <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen in mice for mutations causing dominant thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A mouse exhibiting a decrease in platelet number and increase in mean platelet volume was identified and named <italic>Plt53</italic>. Fifty percent of the progeny from this animal also exhibited macrothrombocytopenia. After backcrossing, exome sequencing of 2 affected animals followed by genotyping of candidate mutations in siblings and offspring revealed that the <italic>Plt53</italic> phenotype correlated with inheritance of a point mutation in the gene encoding TPM4. The mutation, at nucleotide g.72,147,268, was a substitution of A for G in the first dinucleotide of the donor splice site in exon 7 of the <italic>Tpm4</italic> gene (hereafter referred to as <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic>). RT-PCR analysis of cDNA extracted from megakaryocytes revealed that the <italic>Plt53</italic> mutation led to the inclusion of part of intron 7 in the <italic>Tpm4</italic> mRNA. The predicted result is a protein bearing 8 intron-encoded amino acids followed by premature truncation due to the presence of an in-frame stop codon at nucleotide g.72,147,291 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Western blotting with an antibody raised against the TPM4 C-terminus (&#x3B4;/9d) revealed the complete absence of TPM4 in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> platelets, and reduced expression in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, top). The lower band observed with this antibody was not detected with 2 other TPM4 antibodies and is therefore most likely unspecific (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). Using an N-terminal specific antibody (&#x3B4;/1b), we observed a faint band of lower molecular weight in platelets from heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice, indicating the presence of some residual truncated TPM4 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, middle). Given that the overlap of N- and C-termini of TPM dimers is essential for filament formation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), these data indicated that the <italic>Plt53</italic> allele of <italic>Tpm4</italic> represents a complete loss of the protein&#x2019;s canonical function.</p>
        <p>Heterozygous (<italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic>) and homozygous (<italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic>) animals appeared healthy, and histopathological examination revealed no obvious organ abnormalities or pathology. Relative to WT littermates, <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited mild macrothrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> animals a more severe form, with approximately 50% reduction in platelet counts. Remarkably, other peripheral blood cell counts in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> mice were unchanged, with the exception of a modest, but statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0008), increase in lymphocyte counts in the <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow revealed normal numbers of immunophenotypic hematopoietic progenitor cells, including megakaryocyte progenitors, in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Transplantation of unfractionated bone marrow from <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> animals into lethally irradiated adult recipients resulted in macrothrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>), demonstrating that the phenotype was intrinsic to the hematopoietic system. To confirm the <italic>Plt53</italic> mutation as the causative genetic lesion, we generated an independent knockout mouse strain for TPM4.2, the only TPM4 protein isoform expressed in mice. Strikingly, given the early lethality observed in <italic>Tpm1</italic>, <italic>Tpm2</italic>, and <italic>Tpm3</italic> knockouts, animals lacking <italic>Tpm4</italic> were viable and outwardly healthy. They exhibited a dose-dependent macrothrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 3, A&#x2013;C</xref>), similar in magnitude to that observed in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53</sup></italic> mutants on a C57BL/6 background (the background on which the targeted knockout allele was generated) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 3D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate a specific requirement for TPM4 in the megakaryocyte lineage.</p>

        <title>TPM4 insufficiency results in aberrant platelet morphology.</title>
        <p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of platelets from the 2 affected cases from pedigree 1 revealed considerable heterogeneity in platelet size, some of them being very large. We also observed an increased presence of large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). Blinded analysis of TEM pictures correctly identified all the carriers from pedigree 2. Platelets from 2-II-3 and 2-III-5 exhibited moderate defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>) similar to those observed for pedigree 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, A and B</xref>). Platelets from 2-III-7 were obviously different from the control, with an increased small diameter and an ellipsoid rather than discoid shape.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the human data, TEM analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity in the size and morphology of <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> platelets, with frequent vacuoles, indicating increased fragility of the mutant platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Given that ultra-rare variants in <italic>FLNA</italic> (the gene encoding filamin A) have recently been reported to result in fragile platelets and macrothrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and variants in the actin&#x2013;cross-linking protein actinin 1 (&#x3B1;-actinin, <italic>ACTN1</italic>) are one of the most frequent causes of isolated thrombocytopenia with altered platelet morphology (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), we examined the levels of these 2 proteins. Interestingly, we found that filamin A was partially degraded in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> and to a lesser extent <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, top). Levels of full-length actinin 1 were reduced in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> platelets, coinciding with the appearance of an 80-kDa band that has been previously reported to be the result of cleavage by calpain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p>

        <title>Reduced TPM4 expression impacts platelet function.</title>
        <p>We next examined the function of the platelets of the daughter of the propositus of pedigree 1 (case 1-III-7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). In response to any of the agonists ADP, cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL), and TRAP-6, no significant differences in platelet activation measured by integrin &#x3B1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3B2;<sub>3</sub> activation and &#x3B1;-granule secretion were revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, when thrombus formation under flow ex vivo was examined, both the number of thrombi and the area covered were reduced in case 1-III-7 relative to the control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5, B and C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We then probed the impact of TPM4 dysfunction on platelet function in mice. Given that macrothrombocytopenia can be triggered by accelerated platelet clearance, we firstly examined the in vivo lifespan of <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> platelets. No change in the kinetics of clearance or ultimate lifespan was observed, indicating that lack of functional TPM4 did not affect platelet turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Platelet activation was assessed in vitro by flow cytometry using integrin &#x3B1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3B2;<sub>3</sub> activation (JON/A antibody) and &#x3B1;-granule secretion (anti&#x2013;P-selectin antibody) as markers. <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> platelets were responsive to a range of agonists, indicating that the processes of integrin inside-out activation and degranulation are functional in the absence of TPM4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref>). The increased mean fluorescence intensity for integrin &#x3B1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3B2;<sub>3</sub> in the <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> samples was most probably due to the increased size of the mutant platelets, as it correlated with an approximately 37% increase in basal CD41 (integrin &#x3B1;<sub>IIb</sub> subunit) fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). To investigate the involvement of TPM4 in activation-induced morphological changes, we incubated thrombin-activated <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> platelets on fibrinogen-coated coverslips. Under these conditions, platelets from both genotypes fully spread, but the spreading process was significantly delayed in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). As seen with case 1-III-7, thrombus formation on collagen under flow ex vivo was significantly reduced in blood from <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, we found that tail bleeding times were mildly extended in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> mice, and in lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with transplanted <italic>Plt53/Plt53</italic> bone marrow, relative to their respective controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.165 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.045; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 5C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the hemostatic function of TPM4-deficient platelets is mildly compromised.</p>

        <p>Sorting of tropomyosin isoforms to different cellular compartments is thought to be crucial for their function (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

While megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation were unaffected by transduction with shRNAs targeting <italic>TPM4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 7A</xref>), the level of proplatelet formation was reduced in comparison with the nontargeting control. ShRNA_<italic>TPM4B</italic> and shRNA_<italic>TPM4E</italic>, which knocked down mRNA levels to approximately 20% and 8%, respectively, reduced proplatelet formation by approximately 40% and 14%. Logistic regression analysis showed that the correlation between the proportion of proplatelet-forming cells and RNA and protein levels for TPM4 was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 2<sup>&#x2013;16</sup> and &lt; 6.23<sup>&#x2013;12</sup>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>), demonstrating that the level of TPM4 is rate-limiting for platelet formation.</p>
        <p>In mice, we observed a significant increase in megakaryocyte numbers in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). Ploidy profiles were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 7B</xref>). However, mutant megakaryocytes were smaller than WT counterparts (~20% of <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> and ~30% of <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> compared with only ~4% of <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> megakaryocytes were smaller than 50 &#x3BC;m<sup>2</sup>), and many exhibited an irregular morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8, C and D</xref>). Relative to the WT, proplatelet formation was reduced by approximately 40% in fetal liver&#x2013;derived <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> megakaryocytes and by approximately 20% in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E</xref>). Time-lapse video microscopy indicated that, while the initial morphological changes associated with proplatelet formation took place in mutant cells, loss of TPM4 resulted in megakaryocytes with few or no branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Videos 1 and 2</xref>). Where proplatelets did form, their tips were significantly increased in size relative to WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 7C</xref>). Visualization of F-actin and tubulin demonstrated that within the short, thick branches produced by <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> megakaryocytes, massive networks of tubulin were diffusely distributed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate an essential role for TPM4 in platelet shedding and sizing.</p>

        <title>Potential TPM4-interacting proteins in megakaryocytes and platelets.</title>
        <p>Tropomyosins have been reported to interact with several proteins that regulate platelet biogenesis. We examined the actin filament&#x2013;severing proteins actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) and cofilin, as these have been shown to directly compete with tropomyosins for actin binding (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). While ADF expression was unaltered in <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant mouse megakaryocytes and platelets (data not shown), the levels of phosphorylated (inactive) cofilin in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> cells were significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9, A and B</xref>). This suggested enhanced actin turnover in mutant cells. Consistent with this, a reduction in F-actin levels was observed in nonstimulated mutant platelets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given that TPM4 localization was reported to be abnormal in proplatelet tips deficient in tropomodulin 3 (TMOD3) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we investigated TMOD3 localization in cultured <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> megakaryocytes. In line with that study, we observed that TMOD3 localized as puncta with proplatelet membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 9</xref>). While TMOD3 appeared to be more diffusely distributed in some <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> proplatelets, we did not detect major alterations between the mutant and control samples. Besides their well-known interaction with tropomodulins, tropomyosins have also been demonstrated to recruit myosin IIa to stress fibers, and to be involved in stabilization of RHOA (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Inherited mutations in the <italic>MYH9</italic> gene, which encodes nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIa (NMMHC-IIa), give rise to the &#x201C;MYH9-related disorders,&#x201D; all of which exhibit macrothrombocytopenia, and have been linked to the RHOA/ROCK pathway (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We therefore examined the expression and phosphorylation state of RHOA, ROCK, and NMMHC-IIa by Western blot. No differences between <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic>, <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> megakaryocytes and platelets were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 10A</xref>). Confocal microscopy of <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> megakaryocytes undergoing the first morphological changes presaging proplatelet formation revealed that NMMHC-IIa localized to a fine network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 10B</xref>), very similar to the distribution of TPM4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 6B</xref>). This pattern was dramatically perturbed in approximately 50% of <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> megakaryocytes. In WT proplatelet swellings and tips, NMMHC-IIa localized to a previously described characteristic network and to membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>, left, and ref. <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In contrast, NMMHC-IIa in <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> proplatelet-forming megakaryocytes showed a patchy distribution in approximately 70% of cells analyzed, as compared with approximately 15% of <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>, right). These results indicate that TPM4 deficiency impacts multiple regulators of the megakaryocyte actin cytoskeleton.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Cytoskeletal reorganizations are the driving force for the production of platelets by megakaryocytes (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>TPM4</italic>, previously identified by genome-wide association studies as a candidate gene correlated to platelet count and volume, is a modulator of platelet production. <italic>TPM4</italic> insufficiency causes macrothrombocytopenia in mice and humans in a dose-dependent manner.</p>
      <p>The tropomyosin genes and particularly <italic>TPM4</italic> are highly expressed in human and murine megakaryocytes, and the corresponding proteins are abundant in platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Our study demonstrates that relatively modest alterations in <italic>TPM4</italic> dosage are sufficient to impact platelet biogenesis. The level of <italic>TPM4</italic> expression in megakaryocytes determines their ability to produce correctly sized platelets. Our findings strongly suggest that TPM4 localization and interaction with actin filaments and other cytoskeletal components facilitate megakaryocyte branching during proplatelet formation. It has been previously reported that TPM4.2 overexpression in a neuronal cell line augmented branch formation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Both proplatelet formation and neurite branching require extensive localized cytoskeleton-membrane interactions. In line with this, recent reports have shown that TPM4.2-bound actin filaments are found at membrane regions with specialized functions, such as the postsynaptic membrane (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), the external face of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), or podosomes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our findings therefore suggest that the amount of available TPM4-bound actin filaments in megakaryocytes directly determines the amount of membrane regions, which can generate proplatelet branches.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that TPM4 insufficiency affects multiple cytoskeletal regulators with known roles in platelet production, including cofilin, myosin IIa, actinin 1, and filamin A. The abnormal distribution of tubulin, polymerization of which is considered a driving force for proplatelet elongation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), was potentially a downstream effect. Despite recent work suggesting that capping of TPM4-bound actin filaments by TMOD3 is required for proplatelet formation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), TMOD3 localization was not obviously affected in <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant proplatelets. This might be explained by TPM1 or TPM3.1 partially compensating for the lack of TPM4 during proplatelet formation.</p>
      <p>Mice lacking cofilin in the megakaryocyte lineage display macrothrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), suggesting that the correct balance between TPM4 and cofilin is essential for the production of correctly sized platelets. The decreased levels of inactive, phosphorylated, cofilin in <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant megakaryocytes and platelets are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that tropomyosin and cofilin compete with each other at the actin filament (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and indicate that reduced TPM4 expression facilitates increased binding of active cofilin to actin filaments. Mutations in the gene encoding NMMHC-IIa (<italic>MYH9</italic>) in cases with MYH9-related disorders cause autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia and bleeding associated with other complex pathobiologies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Altered localization of NMMHC-IIa was observed in a large proportion of <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant megakaryocytes. This finding is in accordance with a previously established role for TPM4.2 in myosin II recruitment to stress fiber precursors (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and its specific regulatory impact on NMMHC-IIa (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p>
      <p>Reduced TPM4 expression resulted in the production of large platelets with fragile appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Fragile platelets with impaired function are a characteristic of patients with <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), and of <italic>Flna</italic>-null mice (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We observed increased levels of degraded filamin A in <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant platelets. Interaction of filamin A with glycoprotein (GP1B), a component of the VWF receptor complex, is important for regulation of platelet size, as well as platelet adhesion and maintenance of membrane integrity under high shear (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Thus, disturbances in interactions between filamin A and F-actin may contribute to the altered size and function of TPM4-deficient platelets. <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant platelets also exhibited partial degradation of actinin 1. Mutations in the latter cause autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Prior studies have suggested that the levels of actin-binding proteins correlate with fluctuations in tropomyosin isoforms (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Our work indicates that loss of TPM4 binding inhibits binding of other proteins, such as filamin A and actinin 1, to actin filaments. This results in an impairment of the complex actomyosin cytoskeletal network that drives proplatelet formation.</p>
      <p>TPM4 insufficiency affected neither the in vivo platelet lifespan in mice, nor the in vitro platelet functional responses to agonists in humans and mice. The delayed spreading observed in <italic>Tpm4</italic> mutant platelets may be attributed to their increased size, but may also indicate specific defects upon decreased TPM4 expression, potentially involving altered integrin &#x3B1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x3B2;<sub>3</sub> outside-in signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with this, mutant mice, and WT mice with transplanted mutant bone marrow, tended toward prolonged tail bleeding times. Furthermore, thrombus formation on collagen under flow by TPM4-deficient platelets of both human and mouse origin was reduced. Since the platelet disorder associated with the <italic>TPM4</italic> variant results in an unpredictable bleeding phenotype, these findings indicate that reduced levels of TPM4 result in a mild impairment of hemostasis.</p>
      <p>Our findings indicate that, like the targeted knockout, the <italic>TPM4</italic> variants we identified in both humans and mice result in a complete loss of function at the <italic>TPM4</italic> locus. The fact that mice homozygous for the <italic>Plt53</italic> mutation or null allele are healthy and fertile was very surprising, standing in stark contrast to mice lacking <italic>Tpm1</italic>, <italic>Tpm2</italic>, or <italic>Tpm3</italic>, which die in utero (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Thus, TPM4 is the only tropomyosin family member dispensable for development. It plays an essential and highly specific role in F-actin organization in the megakaryocyte lineage. Given the exceptionally high level of conservation between them, the inability of other tropomyosin isoforms to fully compensate for the loss of <italic>TPM4</italic> deletion highlights a profound gap in our understanding of how functional specificity is achieved and governed.</p>

          <p>Mice carrying a mutant <italic>Tpm4</italic> allele, named <italic>Plt53</italic>, were generated. Briefly, male BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with 85 mg/kg ENU weekly for 3 weeks (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).

Animals exhibiting aberrant platelet counts were test-mated to determine heritability of the phenotype. Mutant strains were backcrossed for 10 generations to the BALB/c background in order to breed out irrelevant ENU-induced mutations. <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic> mice were intercrossed to yield <italic>Tpm4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tpm4<sup>Plt53/Plt53</sup></italic> littermates, which were used in experiments.

          <p>Citrated whole blood was incubated for 5 minutes with hirudin and aspirin, before being added to tubes containing HEPES-buffered saline, FITC&#x2013;rabbit anti-fibrinogen antibody (Dako, F0111), and PE&#x2013;mouse anti&#x2013;P-selectin (IBGRL, clone Thromb6) or relevant negative controls (P-selectin isotype, IBGRL, clone 9E10). Platelets were agonized with a final concentration of 0.0005 &#x3BC;M ADP, 0.3 &#x3BC;g/ml CRP-XL, and 0.8 &#x3BC;M TRAP-6 or left untreated. Apyrase was added to platelets agonized with CRP-XL and TRAP-6. Flow cytometry was performed on an FC-500 (Beckman Coulter), and platelets were identified by light scatter. Results were recorded as the percentage of platelets positive for the relevant activation marker.</p>

        <p>Coverslips were coated with 100 &#x3BC;g/ml human fibrinogen and blocked with PBS 1% BSA. After rinsing with Tyrode-HEPES buffer, washed mouse platelets (100 &#x3BC;l with 0.03 &#xD7; 10<sup>6</sup> platelets per microliter) were activated with 0.005 U/ml thrombin and incubated at room temperature for the indicated time periods. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, the coverslips were thoroughly rinsed with PBS, and platelets were visualized with a Deltavision Elite microscope equipped with CoolSnap2 CCD Detector (&#xD7;100/1.4 oil immersion objective). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software.</p>

        <p>Data distribution was analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Statistical significance between 2 experimental groups was analyzed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic> test or a Mann-Whitney test. When more than 2 experimental groups were compared, data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA. When ANOVA indicated that a significant difference was present, individual differences were explored with the 2-tailed unpaired Student&#x2019;s <italic>t</italic> test or Mann-Whitney test using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Prism 7, GraphPad Software). <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant; *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 or as otherwise stated.

        <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the major megakaryocyte <italic>TPM4</italic> transcript ENST00000300933, which is predicted to encode the 248&#x2013;amino acid TPM4 protein (UniProt ID P67936). R69 is transcribed from the second exon of the transcript and is 68 amino acids from the amino-terminus of TPM4. R69X is predicted to cause expression of a truncated TPM4 protein. (<bold>B</bold>) Family trees for pedigree 1 and pedigree 2 with the <italic>TPM4</italic> variant are depicted, including the platelet count, platelet volume, and presence/absence (Y/N) of macrothrombocytes when visualized by electron microscopy (shown in blue). Filled symbols: macrothrombocytopenia; gray symbols, unknown; open symbols: normal platelet count and volume and absence of macrothrombocytes. +/M, heterozygous; +/+, WT. (<bold>C</bold>) Platelet <italic>TPM4</italic> RNA levels measured by RT-PCR using <italic>GAPDH</italic> as housekeeping gene. Graph depicts representative data from a total of <italic>n</italic> = 3 measurements from 1 (case 1-II-5) or 3 (case 1-III-7) patient samples.
