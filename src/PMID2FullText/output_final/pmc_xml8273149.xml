        <p id="P11"><italic>SPTBN1</italic> encodes &#x3B2;II-spectrin, the ubiquitously expressed &#x3B2;-spectrin that forms micrometer-scale networks associated with plasma membranes. Mice deficient in neuronal &#x3B2;II-spectrin have defects in cortical organization, developmental delay, and behavioral deficiencies. These phenotypes, while less severe, are observed in haploinsufficient animals, suggesting that individuals carrying heterozygous <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants may also present with measurable compromise of neural development and function. Here we identify heterozygous <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants in 29 individuals who present with developmental, language and motor delays, mild to severe intellectual disability, autistic features, seizures, behavioral and movement abnormalities, hypotonia, and variable dysmorphic facial features. We show that these <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants lead to effects that affect &#x3B2;II-spectrin stability, disrupt binding to key molecular partners, and disturb cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. Our studies define <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants as the genetic basis of a neurodevelopmental syndrome, expand the set of spectrinopathies affecting the brain, and underscore the critical role of &#x3B2;II-spectrin in the central nervous system.</p>

    <p id="P12">Spectrins are ubiquitously expressed, elongated polypeptides that bind membrane lipids and ankyrins to line the plasma membrane<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The spectrin meshwork is formed by heterodimeric units of &#x3B1;-spectrin and &#x3B2;-spectrin assembled side-to-side in antiparallel fashion, which then form head-to-head tetramers that crosslink F-actin to form spectrin-actin arrays<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Mammalian neurons express the most diverse repertoire of spectrins, which includes &#x3B1;II-spectrin and all five &#x3B2;-spectrins (&#x3B2;I&#x2013;V spectrins)<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Together with ankyrins, spectrins self-assemble with both remarkable long-range regularity and micro- and nanoscale specificity to precisely position and stabilize cell adhesion molecules, membrane transporters, ion channels, and other scaffolding proteins<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Some spectrins also enable intracellular organelle transport<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P14">A cohort of 29 individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder from 28 families (one pair of siblings) who harbor heterozygous variants in <italic>SPTBN1</italic> was identified through whole genome (WGS) or exome (WES) sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). Twenty-eight unique variants are described (P10 has two <italic>de novo</italic> variants in <italic>cis</italic>), of which 22 are missense, three are nonsense, and three are canonical splice-site variants, with two predicted by SpliceAI<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to lead to in-frame deletions and one to a frameshift that introduces a premature stop codon (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Missense variants in codons Gly205, Thr268, Arg411 and Arg1003 were identified in multiple individuals (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Approximately half of the variants cluster in the second CH domain (CH2), with the rest distributed in various spectrin repeats (SR) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Twenty-four individuals carry <italic>de novo</italic> variants, with proband P10 having two <italic>de novo</italic> variants in <italic>cis</italic> (p.(Thr268Ala) and p.(Phe344Leu)). Mosaicism in P17 (13.3% of reads) suggests that the p.(Glu491Gln) variant occurred <italic>de novo</italic>. Two maternal half-siblings (P21 and P22) inherited the p.(Arg1003Trp) variant from their unaffected mother, who is mosaic for the variant at a low level (1.8% of next generation sequencing reads).</p>

The cohort included 17 male and 12 female probands (P) spanning from six months to 26 years of age at last evaluation. All but one proband had early onset of symptoms with primarily DD presentations, with 21 reporting ID. Developmental regression was noted in P9, P10, and P12. P29 exhibited mild delays; however, the primary symptom, dystonia, was observed at age 13<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Similarly, while delays were noted for P23, the primary phenotype was liver-related. Only partial phenotype information was obtained for previously reported P4 and P25<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, as well as for P3 from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DECIPHER) database<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="P17">Nine individuals have a history of seizures, four of whom were diagnosed with frontal lobe or generalized epilepsy. Seven individuals had abnormal brain MRI findings, including P2, P10, and P28 with thinning of the corpus callosum (CC) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), P1 and P16 with ventriculomegaly (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), P2 and P22 with delayed myelination, and P1 and P10 respectively showing diffuse cerebral parenchymal (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>) and mild cerebellar and vermian atrophy. Other brain MRI findings were unique (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>). Behavioral concerns were common within the cohort. Six individuals displayed autistic features or had an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis, including P19 and P24 previously reported in a WES study of ASD individuals<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. P25 was identified in a WES study of Tourette syndrome cohorts<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Fifteen individuals presented with other behavioral concerns, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) (<italic>n</italic> = 12), anxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 3), obsessive behavior (<italic>n</italic> = 3), emotional liability (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and aggressive or self-injurious behaviors (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Seven individuals experienced sleep disturbances, in some cases co-occurring with seizure episodes. Additional findings include changes in muscle tone, movement abnormalities, hearing impairments, dysmorphic features (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), and head size and shape anomalies (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P18">Individuals with the same or similar genetic variation display phenotypic variability. The c.3007C&gt;T (p.(Arg1003Trp)) variant was identified in P20 and in maternal half-siblings P21 and P22 of an unrelated family. While all three have DD features, only P21 reported seizures, only P22 reported abnormal brain MRI, and P21 did not report behavioral or emotional concerns. Similarly, variants in unrelated duos P4 and P5, and P15 and P16 affect p.Gly205 and p.Arg411 residues, respectively, but result in different amino acid substitutions. All these individuals have DD, P4 and P5 had an abnormal EEG, and P15 and P16 had hypotonia, but each also has some distinct features consistent with variability in the cohort. Likewise, unrelated P10, P11, and P12 carry different amino acid substitutions in p.Thr268 and present with overlapping phenotypes. Notably, P10 has two &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants in <italic>cis</italic> (p.(Thr268Ala) and p.(Phe344Leu)), which may contribute to the more severe phenotype. Of note, P19 was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and has a variant in <italic>NF1</italic> (c.3449C&gt;G; p.(Ser1150*)), which likely would not explain the behavioral challenges and autism in this individual.

        <p id="P21">To assess the pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants, we introduced a subset of these variants in GFP-tagged human &#x3B2;II-spectrin (GFP-&#x3B2;IISp), transfected the constructs into HEK 293T/17 cells, either alone or with pmCherry-C1, and monitored their effects on GFP-&#x3B2;IISp levels, localization, and stability. Of the 25 variants tested, protein levels of seven were changed relative to control (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Nonsense variants (p.C183*, p.E892* and p.W1787*) yielded GFP-&#x3B2;IISp fragments of the expected size, suggesting that the truncated products are structurally stable. The p.G205D and p.G205S variants reduced GFP-&#x3B2;IISp protein levels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>) and solubility (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>,<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Transduction of &#x3B2;II-spectrin null cortical neurons with lentivirus expressing selected RFP-&#x3B2;II-spectrin variants resulted in protein expression trends similar to the ones observed in HEK 293T/17 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). Endogenous levels of full-length (250 kDa) &#x3B2;II-spectrin were not changed in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines reprogrammed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from P12 (p.(Thr268Ser)), P21 (p.(Arg1003Trp)), and P28 (p.(E1886Q)) relative to its expression in iPSC from a 13 year old healthy subject<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>).

This result suggests that the transcript harboring p.(Trp1787*) does not undergo efficient non-sense mediated decay (NMD), which is supported by RNA-seq of blood RNA showing allelic expression bias with 28% of reads carrying the variant (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>

Correspondingly, expression of CH domain variants in HEK 293T/17 cells resulted in depletion of membrane-bound GFP-&#x3B2;IISp and in cytosolic aggregates containing actin and mCherry-&#x3B1;IISp (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, arrowheads and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>).

        <p id="P25">We evaluated whether &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants affect binding to cytoskeletal partners based on their position in domains that are critical for interaction with specific partners. We first assessed whether variants disrupted the formation of &#x3B2;II-spectrin/&#x3B1;II-spectrin complexes by incubating GFP beads coupled to WT or mutant GFP-&#x3B2;IISp with mCherry-&#x3B1;IISp lysates and measuring mCherry-&#x3B1;IISp levels in pulldown eluates. As expected, C183* GFP-&#x3B2;IISp, which lacks the SR1&#x2013;SR2 heterodimerization domain<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, neither associated with nor sequestered mCherry-&#x3B1;IISp or endogenous &#x3B1;II-spectrin into GFP-&#x3B2;IISp aggregates (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Pulldown of mCherry-&#x3B1;II-spectrin with p.G205D and p.G205S GFP-&#x3B2;IISp baits yielded less &#x3B1;II-/&#x3B2;II-spectrin complexes, partly due to the lower expression of these variants, but also indicating lower affinity for &#x3B1;II-spectrin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>).

        <p id="P26">Next, we evaluated whether CH domain variants affect binding to F-actin using a co-sedimentation assay. GFP-&#x3B2;II-spectrin containing a PreScission protease (PP) cleavage site between GFP and &#x3B2;II-spectrin (GFP-PP-&#x3B2;IISp) was captured on GFP beads. Purified WT and mutant proteins were recovered from beads upon PP cleavage and mixed with purified F-actin. The partition of &#x3B2;II-spectrin between soluble (S) and actin-containing pellet (P) fractions was used to assess binding between both proteins. p.T59I, p.I159_Q160del, p.Y190_R216del, and p.D255E variants reduced F-actin binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, p.V271M and p.H275R variants increased F-actin binding, while p.

This affinity range is likely due to both local and CH domain-wide conformational changes caused by modified intramolecular interactions that impact intermolecular contacts at the &#x3B2;II-spectrin/F-actin interface. Surprisingly, the p.A850G variant, located several SR away from the CH domains, also increased F-actin binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>), which may explain its effects on cell morphology (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2h</xref>,<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">i</xref>).</p>

The electrostatic surface profile of &#x3B2;II-spectrin CH1 and CH2 domains modeled using an available crystal structure of utrophin<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> indicates that they each have one electrically active side complementary to each other and one neutral side, consistent with an energetically balanced closed conformation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). This model indicates that six mutated CH domain residues reside at the CH1&#x2013;CH2 dimer interface, potentially impacting interdomain helix-helix interactions, thereby dysregulating the natural autoinhibition (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P29">To refine our prediction of the closed conformation of the &#x3B2;II-spectrin CH1&#x2013;CH2 domain and to identify interactions at the interface, we docked the CH2 domain (residues 173&#x2013;278) of &#x3B2;II-spectrin<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> onto the modeled structure of the &#x3B2;III-spectrin CH1 domain (residues 55&#x2013;158) (95% homologous with &#x3B2;II-spectrin)<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and chose the top docking pose (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This pose was the same compared to the closed conformations of actinin-4 (PDB ID 6oa6) (unpublished) and utrophin (PDB ID 1qag)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i</xref> summarizes the predicted key interacting residues at the CH1&#x2013;CH2 interface and the structural consequences of variants in those domains. Residues affected by variants p.T59 in CH1 and p.L250, p.T268, and p.H275 in CH2 are predicted to participate in interdomain interactions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>). The missense variants in these and in the two other interface residues p.D255 and p.V271 likely introduce destabilizing effects (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). For example, substitutions of T268 by alanine (A) (smaller and more hydrophobic), serine (S) (loss of methyl group), and asparagine (N) (larger and more hydrophilic) likely alter the hydrophobic interaction of T268 with p.L155 in CH1 and p.I159 in the CH1&#x2013;CH2 linker differently. However, it appears that any potential conformational changes in the CH1&#x2013;CH2 domain that may result from these amino acid changes in p.T268 are not sufficient to cause appreciable changes in F-actin binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). Similarly, the p.D255E variant causes a relatively small residue change that does not alter F-actin affinity. Conversely, the p.V271M (larger and hydrophobic) and the p.H275R (longer and significantly more hydrophilic) substitutions may impair CH1 binding to cause a shift towards the open CH1&#x2013;CH2 conformation and higher F-actin affinity. This is also expected for the p.L250R variant, which likely causes significant steric hindrance by the clashing of the large, charged residue with a hydrophobic CH1 pocket (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). In line with this prediction, p.L250R GFP-&#x3B2;IISp aggregates in cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Conversely, p.T59I introduces a slightly longer but more hydrophobic group that might promote a stronger interaction with p.L250 in CH2, potentially shifting the equilibrium to a CH1&#x2013;CH2 closed configuration consistent with less F-actin binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P30">p.G205D/S and p.L247H substitutions in the interior of CH2 are predicted to cause instability due to significant steric hindrance (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). p.G205D and p.G205S introduce destabilization by positioning an interior negative charge and steric hindrance against the neighbor N233 and L234 side chains (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">h</xref>), which likely underlies protein aggregation in cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">c</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). The in-frame deletion p.Y190_R216del also results in &#x3B2;II-spectrin aggregation and diminished F-actin binding (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>,<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). In these cases, the autoinhibitory interactions will also be lost if the structure of the CH2 domain is compromised. To explore whether some of the mutants are involved in binding F-actin, we independently docked the CH1 and CH2 domains onto an F-actin model built from chains A&#x2013;F of 6anu<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> using ClusPro<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). The top eight CH1 docking poses predicted by the balanced and electrostatic scoring algorithms almost all corresponded to the location and orientation of CH1 molecules on F-actin as defined by the cryo-EM structure 6anu (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>, dark blue). For CH2 docking onto F-actin, the top eight docking poses predicted by the balanced and electrostatic scoring algorithms almost all correspond to symmetry-related locations and poses on F-actin (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition, the predicted orientation of CH2 molecules on F-actin is consistent with the known binding site of the CH1 domain, as judged by the length of the linker that would be required to join the C-terminus of the docked CH1 domain to the N-terminus of the docked CH2 domain (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3f</xref>). Our model predicts that neither the T59 residue nor its mutated version are directly involved in F-actin binding (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). The p.H275R variant may interact more strongly with negatively charged D51 in F-actin (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3e</xref>) to contribute to its higher actin binding propensity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). We also modeled the missense variants in the SR domains (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). Except for p.F344L, all SR variants face outwards, to the solvent, and could be involved in protein binding at the interface. Interestingly, all variants within the second and third helices of the spectrin fold result in neutral or more hydrophobic residues, and those in the first helix of the SR are more hydrophilic. Given the consistency of this trend, it possibly underlies a conserved functional role important for heterodimerization and larger order assemblies.</p>
        <p id="P32">In sum, our modeling results provide a strong molecular rationale for several of the biochemical and cellular observations described above, which implicate protein stability, abnormal assembly and dynamics of the &#x3B2;II-spectrin-F-actin skeleton, and potential disruptions of &#x3B2;II-spectrin binding to other molecular partners, consistent with similar changes caused by variants in other members of the spectrin superfamily<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.</p>

        <p id="P33">Individuals with <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants display a wide range of neurological presentations that are consistent with phenotypes of neural progenitor-specific &#x3B2;II-spectrin null mice<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Neurons from these mice show disruption of the spectrin-actin MPS<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, impaired axon initial segment (AIS) organization and axonal growth, and reduced axonal organelle transport<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. These reports and our initial cellular and molecular observations suggest that mutant &#x3B2;II-spectrin may disrupt the organization and dynamics of the neuronal cytoskeleton, and the morphology and function of neurons. Thus, we next investigated the effects of disease-linked variants using a structure-function rescue approach in &#x3B2;II-SpKO cortical neurons.</p>
        <p id="P34">First, we expressed WT and mutant GFP-&#x3B2;IISp together with mCherry in day <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 3 &#x3B2;II-SpKO cortical neurons<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and evaluated axonal growth and AIS morphology at DIV8. We also evaluated WT (<italic>Sptbn1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup>/+) and heterozygous (<italic>Sptbn1</italic><sup><italic>fl</italic></sup><italic>o</italic><sup><italic>x</italic>/+</sup>;Nestin-Cre; henceforth abbreviated as &#x3B2;II-SpHet) neurons. Axonal length was impaired in &#x3B2;II-SpKO neurons but restored upon expression of WT GFP-&#x3B2;IISp (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). &#x3B2;II-SpHet axons grew to only half the length of WT axons but were almost twice as long as &#x3B2;II-SpKO axons (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Most mutant GFP-&#x3B2;IISp proteins failed to rescue axonal length to WT levels, while p.A1086T and p.E1110D restored length to heterozygous levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). AIS from &#x3B2;II-SpKO cortical neurons exhibited normal length but abnormal ankyrin-G (AnkG) clustering as fragmented puncta as previously observed<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>, which was restored by WT GFP-&#x3B2;IISp and by a subset of the variants (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). p.Y190_R216del, p.T268S, p.H275R, p.R411W, and p.G1398S GFP-&#x3B2;II failed to rescue AIS AnkG clustering (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>).

        <p id="P35">Organelle transport is essential for the maintenance of neuronal processes and neuron viability, and defects in transport can contribute to the pathology of several neurological diseases<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. We previously showed that &#x3B2;II-spectrin promotes axonal organelle transport independently of its role assembling the MPS<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Expression of WT &#x3B2;II-spectrin in &#x3B2;II-spectrin null cortical neurons rescues the processivity, motility, and flux of synaptic vesicles and lysosomes<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. To evaluate the effects of selected &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants on axonal transport, we tracked the dynamics of the endosome/lysosome marker RFP-LAMP1. Loss of &#x3B2;II-spectrin impaired the bidirectional motility of LAMP1-RFP cargo and caused deficits in their run length and retrograde velocity (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>). Remarkably, &#x3B2;II-spectrin haploinsufficiency caused similar deficits (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>), indicating that 50% reduction of &#x3B2;II-spectrin levels is insufficient to maintain normal organelle transport. As expected<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, deficient lysosome dynamics in &#x3B2;II-SpKO neurons was rescued by expression of WT GFP-&#x3B2;IISp. However, selected variants that do not rescue axonal length also fail to restore lysosome dynamics (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">g</xref>), including p.E892* and p.W1787* GFP-&#x3B2;IISp, which lack the PH domain required for &#x3B2;II-spectrin coupling to organelle membranes<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. It is possible that the abnormal binding to molecular partners observed in other mutants unable to rescue organelle dynamics interfere with the formation of complexes between &#x3B2;II-spectrin and molecular motors, its coupling to organelle membranes, or its cytosol to MPS partitioning.</p>
        <p id="P36">We also evaluated the effect of &#x3B2;II-spectrin deficiency or expression of GFP-&#x3B2;IISp variants on dendritic morphology of DIV18 cortical neurons. Both &#x3B2;II-spectrin reduction (&#x3B2;II-SpHet) and total loss (&#x3B2;II-SpKO) resulted in shorter dendritic processes relative to WT (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), but the number of primary and secondary dendrites remained unchanged (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>,<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Dendritic morphology of &#x3B2;II-SpKO neurons was rescued by WT GFP-&#x3B2;II-Sp (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast, CH domain variants that caused GFP-&#x3B2;IISp aggregation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">c</xref>) also led to a significant decrease in dendrite number and length, whereas variants p.E892* and p.W1787* reduced dendrite number but not length (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). The other variants evaluated led to a range of alterations in dendritic morphology (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). CH domain variants often produced extensive aberrant membrane features in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia around the cell body and along the neuronal processes (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Neuronal membrane expansion was accompanied by a shift in the boundaries of actin and &#x3B1;II-spectrin distribution (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). Together, these results confirm that clinically relevant &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants can cause marked disruptions in neuronal architecture, likely driven by changes in submembrane cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, which may be a pathogenic factor in <italic>SPTBN1</italic>-associated syndrome.</p>

Deficient connectivity of long axonal tracts can also result from defects in neuronal migration and axonal pathfinding, which is affected by glial cells<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. To determine the neuron-specific effects of &#x3B2;II-spectrin depletion on CC wiring, we generated mice selectively lacking &#x3B2;II-spectrin in projection neurons driven by Nex-Cre<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> (<italic>Sptbn1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup>;Nex-Cre; henceforth &#x3B2;IISp-Nex KO). &#x3B2;II-spectrin loss or haploinsufficiency only in cortical projection neurons is sufficient to induce CC hypoplasia (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>). Finally, CC malformations could arise from deficits in the development of cortical layers given that callosal axons originate primarily from projection neurons of layer II/III and layer V of the neocortex, which are specified by Satb2 and Ctip2 expression, respectively<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Consistent with this prediction, PND0 &#x3B2;II-SpKO brains show reductions in the thickness of cortical layers II/III and V relative to overall cortical thickness (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). A trend towards a significant deficit in the formation of Sabt2 and Ctip2 layers was observed in &#x3B2;II-SpHet mice brains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>,<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Combined, these results suggest that partial &#x3B2;II-spectrin LOF can produce neuronal miswiring in the cortex and those defects are at least in part neuron-autonomous.</p>

First, we evaluated the effects of complete LOF using &#x3B2;II-SpKO mice, which do not survive longer than post-natal day (PND) 40<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and were only challenged with open field and acoustic startle tests at PND30. &#x3B2;II-SpKO mice had overt hyperactivity during the open field test (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>) and profound deficits in rearing, a response requiring good hind limb function and balance (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>). &#x3B2;II-SpKO mice also showed decreases in startle response amplitudes, but normal levels of prepulse inhibition (PPI) (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>,<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">c</xref>), suggesting that reduced startle responses were due to motor deficits, rather than alterations in auditory function or sensorimotor gating.

        <p id="P40">We next characterized behavioral phenotypes of &#x3B2;II-SpHet mice, whose normal lifespan allowed for an expanded battery of tests.

Loss of ankyrin-B isoforms in mice result in axonal transport deficits<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> and defects in brain connectivity<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, two overlapping phenotypes observed in &#x3B2;II-spectrin mouse models. Although ankyrin-B and &#x3B2;II-spectrin independently modulate axonal transport<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, they may converge through mechanisms that affect other neuronal functions. For example, ankyrin-B loss affects the polarized distribution of &#x3B2;II-spectrin in neurites, which causes its more even partitioning between axons and dendrites, and a higher prevalence of dendritic MPS<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. The defects in dendrite development induced by several &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants suggest an additional pathogenic mechanism that can affect synaptic function. Conversely, disruption of the MPS due to loss of &#x3B2;II-spectrin<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> may disrupt the periodic distribution of ankyrin-B and its membrane partners in axons<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, which may be essential for signal transduction events<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>. Our results together with these observations support the association of <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants with ASD and ADHD.</p>
      <p id="P42">Seizures and epilepsy were re-occurring phenotypes in our cohort. That <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants may have epileptogenic effects is not surprising given the strong association of <italic>de novo</italic> and inherited variants in <italic>SPTAN1</italic> (&#x3B1;II-spectrin) with epileptic syndromes<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Although the precise pathogenic mechanism of <italic>SPTAN1</italic> in epilepsy has not been fully elucidated, &#x3B1;II-spectrin aggregation has been reported for several disease variants<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. As we show, &#x3B1;II-spectrin cellular distribution can be disrupted by mutant &#x3B2;II-spectrin to cause these partners to co-aggregate, or otherwise continue to associate in aberrant cellular patterns. On the other hand, variants such as p.(T59I) in P1, who presents with epilepsy, affect neither the levels nor the cellular distribution of &#x3B1;II-spectrin, which indicates the possibility of an epileptogenic mechanism independent of &#x3B1;II-spectrin. It is possible that AIS structural defects caused by &#x3B2;II-spectrin deficiencies alter the clustering of ion channels and action potential firing. Going forward, it will be critical to elucidate whether these tightly intertwined partners share pathways disrupted in channelopathies underlying seizures and epilepsy.</p>
      <p id="P43">Besides the widely shared DD phenotype in our cohort, further evidence of the pathogenicity of <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants is the recurrence of <italic>de novo</italic> variants in the same amino acid position in unrelated individuals who share clinical manifestations, but also diverge in some presentations, likely due to differences in the amino acid substitution, sex, age, and genetic background. Another striking indicator of convergence in the pathogenic mechanism of the &#x3B2;II-spectrin variants is their clustering within the CH domains. The region of <italic>SPTBN1</italic> encoding the CH domains has a higher degree of missense variant constraint than the rest of the protein in the population (ExAC v.10)<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>, indicating its importance for protein function and supporting the pathogenicity of the variants within. Our cellular and biochemical findings suggest that CH domain variants affect &#x3B2;II-spectrin&#x2019;s interaction with F-actin and &#x3B1;II-spectrin and alter cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular morphology. The aberrant accumulation of mutant &#x3B2;II-spectrin within cytosolic aggregates suggests that a subset of the CH domain variants introduce destabilizing structural effects, which is supported by our modeling. These aggregates, which sequestered F-actin and &#x3B1;II-spectrin, likely contribute to deficits in neuronal development and morphology through dominant-negative effects. Similarly, altered &#x3B2;II-spectrin binding to F-actin, through gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects, may promote aberrant neuronal membrane morphology and changes in dendrite development. Interestingly, pathogenic CH domain variants have been reported in &#x3B2;I-spectrin<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> and &#x3B2;III-spectrin<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and shown to affect F-actin binding<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Together with our results, this evidence indicates that the abnormal modulation of F-actin binding by CH domain variants likely constitute a conserved pathogenic mechanism in spectrinopathies.</p>
      <p id="P44">Like in other spectrinopathies<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, missense variants affecting SR are likely to be disease-causing in the <italic>SPTBN1</italic>-associated syndrome, although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. For example, it is not clear how p.A850G phenocopies some of the cellular phenotypes caused by various CH domain variants. It is possible that p.A850G affects &#x3B2;II-spectrin/F-actin dynamics through allosteric mechanisms or dominant-negative effects due to overexpression. Alternatively, this and the other SR variants may disrupt &#x3B2;II-spectrin association with undefined binding partners or its coupling to organelles and motor proteins<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="P45">Given the wide expression of &#x3B2;II-spectrin in non-neuronal brain cells, it will be important to assess if their function is affected by <italic>SPTBN1</italic> variants. It is likely that the clinical variability observed in this cohort is at least partly rooted in the multifunctionality and ubiquitous expression of &#x3B2;II-spectrin, although some of the clinical manifestations may be caused by an alternate etiology. For example, the pathogenic <italic>NF1</italic> variant in P19 may contribute to the learning disabilities, but likely not the behavioral challenges and autism in this individual. Finally, given the critical roles &#x3B2;II-spectrin plays in other organs<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> and its association with other non-neurological disorders in probands from our cohort, the <italic>SPTBN1</italic> syndrome warrants thorough clinical assessment and further studies in human iPSC-derived cellular systems, animal models and beyond the brain.</p>

The ClusPro protein-protein docking webserver<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> was used to (i) dock the CH1 domain of spectrin onto F-actin, (ii) dock the CH2 domain of spectrin onto F-actin, and (iii) dock the CH2 domain of spectrin onto the CH1 domain of spectrin. The CH1 structure used for the dockings reported here was the model of the CH1 domain of &#x3B2;III-spectrin from 6anu (chain a)<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>.

The CH1 domain of &#x3B2;III-spectrin shares 95% sequence identity with the CH1 domain of &#x3B2;II-spectrin. The actin model corresponded to chains A&#x2013;F of 6anu, which in turn was generated from the cryo-EM structure of actin (PDB 5jlh)<sup><xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref></sup>.

        <p id="P70">To identify the inactive closed conformation of the tandem domain (CH1&#x2013;CH2) of &#x3B2;II-spectrin, the CH2 domain of &#x3B2;II-spectrin was docked onto the CH1 domain of &#x3B2;II-spectrin using the ClusPro webserver V2.0. The top 15 docking poses for each of the four scoring algorithms were evaluated for the placement of &#x3B2;II-spectrin residue L250 from the CH2 domain at the interface of the CH2/CH1 closed conformation. The top docking pose in the electrostatic scoring algorithm corresponded to a pose with a deeply buried L250 at the interface of the CH1/CH2 complex. The variant of the equivalent residue in &#x3B2;III-spectrin (L253P) might disrupt the closed structure and drive the spectrin ensemble to a more open state suitable for binding to actin<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. This same docking pose was also a top docking pose (pose 4) within the set of poses calculated by the balanced scoring algorithm. This pose was used for evaluation of the &#x3B2;II-spectrin mutants. It was also the same pose compared to the actinin-4 (PDB 6oa6) (unpublished) and utrophin (PDB 1qag)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> closed conformations.</p>
        <p id="P71">For each of the three ClusPro protein docking analyses, the webserver provided up to 30 docking poses for each of four scoring algorithms (balanced; electrostatic-favored; hydrophobic-favored; VdW+Elec). The top 15 poses from each of the four scoring algorithms were included in the final analysis. For the dockings of the CH1 and CH2 domains from &#x3B2;II-spectrin onto F-actin, several of the top docking poses were to the ends of the actin segment defined as the receptor. These docking poses were immediately rejected as other actin molecules would be binding at those locations in F-actin and these sites would not be available for binding to spectrin. For CH1 docking onto F-actin, the remaining poses within the top eight docking poses predicted by the balanced and electrostatic scoring algorithms almost all corresponded to the location and orientation of CH1 molecules on actin as defined by the cryo-EM structure 6anu. For CH2 docking onto F-actin, the remaining poses within the top 8 docking poses predicted by the balanced and electrostatic scoring algorithms almost all corresponded to symmetry-related locations and poses on the F-actin. In addition, the predicted orientation of the CH2 molecules on F-actin was consistent with the known binding site of the CH1 domains, as judged by the length of the linker that would be required to join the C-terminus of the docked CH1 domain to the N-terminus of the docked CH2 domain.</p>

Selective quadrant search was evaluated by measuring number of crosses over the location where the platform (the target) had been placed during training, versus the corresponding areas in the other three quadrants.</p>

        <p id="P82">All testing was conducted by experimenters blinded to mouse genotype. StatView 5.0.1 (SAS, Cary, NC) was used for data analyses. One-way or repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine effects of genotype. Post-hoc analyses were conducted using Fisher&#x2019;s Protected Least Significant Difference (PLSD) tests only when a significant F value was found in the ANOVA. Within-genotype repeated measures analyses were used to determine side preference in the 3-chamber test and quadrant preference in the Morris water maze assay.
