MicroRNAs, especially miR-17, contribute to cell cycle regulation and proliferation. Recent investigations have highlighted the dysregulated expression of miR-17 in various malignancies, underlining its potential role in cancer. However, the correlation between primary cilia and miR-17 has yet to be fully elucidated. The present study examines the presence of miR-17 in primary cilia. The miR-17 expression is studied in selected ciliary protein knockdown cells. Using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH), we identified the subcellular localization of miR-17 in both cilium and cell body. We confirmed the importance of miR-17, progesterone receptor membrane component-2 (PGRMC2), and monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3S) in cilia formation, as shown by the significant reduction in cilia and cilia length in knockdown cells compared to control. We also demonstrated the involvement of PGRMC2, GM3S, polycystin-2 (PKD2), and miR-17 in cellular proliferation and cell growth. Our studies revealed a hyperproliferative effect in the knockdown cells compared to control cells, suggesting the regulatory roles of PGRMC2/GM3S/PKD2/miR-17 in promoting cell proliferation. Overall, our studies conclude that ciliary proteins are involved in cell division and proliferation. We further hypothesize that primary cilia can serve as compartments to store and control genetic materials, further implicating their complex involvement in cellular processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p>

      <title>1 Introduction</title>
      <p>The group of short non-coding RNA molecules (approximately 18&#x2013;24 nucleotides in length) known as microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in both normal physiological and pathological conditions (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Reinhart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bartel, 2004</xref>). Substantial evidence supports the notion that miRNAs act as negative regulator of gene expressions by facilitating mRNA degradation and inhibiting protein translation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bartel, 2004</xref>). Among the various miRNA clusters, the miRNA-17/92 (miR-17/92) cluster has emerged to have a significant role in development. Members of miR-17/92 cluster include miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92a (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2017</xref>). The most prominent component of the miR-17/92 cluster is miR-17, which has a critical role in regulating most of the fundamental cellular functions such as cell cycle, cell proliferation, migration, and many others (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cloonan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>The miR-17 can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cloonan et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, miR-17 has been identified as an oncogene in cancer through extensive miRNome investigations (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Volinia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2009</xref>). These investigations demonstrate that miR-17 levels are significantly overexpressed in different types of solid tumors such as breast, lung, pancreas, colon, and prostate (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Volinia et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, miR-17 is identified as tumor-suppressive miRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The inhibition of miR-17 leads to upregulation of genes that are involved in the cell cycle (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sweat et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, it is found that high serum levels of miR-17 decrease patients&#x2019; survival with lung cancer (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). These results collectively imply that the function of miR-17 in structures is associated with cell cycle regulation.</p>
      <p>The primary cilia are hair-like organelles that are found on the surface of almost all mammalian cells. The ciliary membrane encloses the cilia, which the microtubule supports. The primary cilia principal function involves sensing and transmitting signaling pathways triggered by mechanical and chemical stimuli (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Praetorius and Spring 2003</xref>). These signaling pathways are critical in various cellular processes such as development, differentiation, and cell division (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Singla and Reiter, 2006</xref>). Consequently, mutations that result in structural defects in primary cilia give rise to various diseases collectively known as ciliopathies (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lovera and L&#xFC;ders, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ansley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Shao et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
      <p>Ciliogenesis is a complex biological process in which the cilia are assembled and maintained on the surface of cells (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>). The regulation of ciliogenesis is dynamically controlled during the cell cycle, with cilia being expressed and present during the G0 and G1 phases but undergoing resorption before entering mitosis (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Plotnikova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>). This inverse relationship between primary cilia and cell proliferation is notable, as the primary cilium is reabsorbed into basal body (centrosome) during cell division, where the centrosome assumes the role of the mitotic pole (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Goto et al., 2013</xref>). miR-17 is largely known to regulate cell cycle progression through several signaling proteins. miR-17 regulates E2F1, a critical regulator of cell cycle progression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">O&#x2019;Donnell et al., 2005</xref>). miR-17 can downregulate expression of Cyclin D1, essential regulator of the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Karami et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). miR-17 targets and downregulates p21, affecting cell cycle control and promoting cell proliferation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). miR-17 can also indirectly affect the RB1, a tumor suppressor protein that controls the cell cycle by inhibiting E2F transcription factors (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Trompeter et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
      <p>The relationship between cilia and miR-17 has been previously examined in ciliopathy polycystic kidney disease (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Noureddine et al., 2013</xref>). miR-17 targets and reduces the expression of KIF3A, which affects the assembly and function of cilia (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2013b</xref>). KIF3A is a component of the kinesin motor protein complex involved in the infraglabellar transport (IFT) necessary for ciliogenesis and ciliary maintenance. In addition, miR-17 has been shown to downregulate polycystin-1 (PKD1) and polycystin-2 (PKD2), crucial for the mechanosensory function of primary cilia in polycystic kidney disease (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lakhia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, miR-17 may contribute to ciliary function and cyst formation.</p>
      <p>Ultrastructural analysis of the ciliary bulb (or extracellular vesicle) reveals that miR-17 interacts with other ciliary proteins, including monosialodihexosylganglioside synthase (GM3S) and polycystin-2 (PKD2) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, some novel ciliary proteins have been recently identified. These cilia proteins include bone morphogenetic type 2 (BMPR2), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPRS), and progesterone receptor membrane component-2 (PGRMC2) localized in the cilia (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanistic association between miR-17 and all these ciliary proteins is not currently known. Here, we examined if and how miR-17 interacted with all these proteins. We also studied miR-17 in cell division in relations with the ciliary proteins. We focused on the roles of miR-17 in cell division through primary cilia and its related mechanisms. Specifically, we investigated miR-17 knockdown epithelial cells and explored the proliferative effects and impact on cilia.</p>

        <title>2.1 Cell culture</title>
        <p>Porcine renal epithelial cells (LLC-PK1; ATCC #CL-101) were cultured to a confluent monolayer in Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Corning, catalog no. 10-013-CV) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Cytiva HyClone&#x2122;, catalog no. SH309100340) at 37&#xB0;C in 5% CO2 incubator. We selected seven ciliary proteins to study: bone morphogenetic type 2 (BMPR2), junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A/F11R), progesterone receptor membrane component-2 (PGRMC2), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3S), and polycystin-2 (PKD2). Stable knockdown cells for each of the seven corresponding genes and scrambled control cells were previously generated in our laboratory (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

        <title>2.2 <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization</title>
        <p>The <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization was used to identify the sub-cellular localization of miR-17. A miRCURY LNA&#x2122; Kit (Exiqon Inc. Qiagen, catalog no. 90000) was used for the <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization targeting the microRNA miR-17. The Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) probe for miR-17 was also obtained from Exiqon (Exiqon Inc. Qiagen, Design ID. 73515 cat no. 699990). The probe sequence was: 5&#x2032;-TAC CTG CAC TGT AAG CAC TTT G-3&#x2019;. The probe was tagged with Texas Red fluorescence TEX615. Cells were seeded into 18 &#xD7; 18 coverslips (Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 12&#x2013;542A) and incubated under normal growth conditions overnight until they reached 60%&#x2013;70% confluency. Subsequently, the cells were then fixed for 10&#xA0;min with 4% paraformaldehyde/2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Corning, catalog no 21-040-CV) at room temperature, followed by permeabilization for 5&#xA0;min with 10% triton X-100. Acetylated &#x3B1;-tubulin primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. T6793) (1:10,000 dilution) was incubated with the cells overnight at 4&#xB0;C for cilia visualization and staining, FITC conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000) was used. 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of the probe was denatured at 80&#xB0;C for 75&#xA0;s. After hybridization of the slide in a humidified chamber for 30&#xA0;min, the slide was then mounted with DAPI. We used a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with NIS-Elements imaging software to capture images of primary cilia. To calculate the signal intensity of miR-17, we first identified the presence of cilia via acetylated-&#x3B1;-tubulin ciliary marker. A region of interest (ROI) was made based on the ciliary marker. This ROI was then transferred to the &#x201C;miR-17&#x201D; image. Signal intensity of this ROI was denoted as &#x201C;cilium&#x201D;. On the same &#x201C;miR-17&#x201D; image, cell boundary was drawn as our ROI and denoted as &#x201C;total&#x201D;. The intensity of miR-17 on the cell body was then calculated using the following formula (<xref rid="e1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>).<disp-formula id="e1">

        <p>After growing the cells in a 100-mm culture dish beyond confluence, the cells were washed briefly with 10&#xA0;mL of PBS. The cell culture dishes were placed on MaxQ&#x2122; 2508 rotary shaker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. CPA2480 3523-51) for 5&#xA0;min at 350 rotations per minute (rpm). The PBS containing the isolated primary cilia was centrifuged at 4&#xB0;C for 15&#xA0;min at 1,000 &#xD7; g using Legend X1R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Product No: B06320). The supernatant containing the isolated primary cilia was then transferred to a polyallomer tube and centrifuged for 30&#xA0;min at 50,000 &#xD7; g (16,700&#xA0;rpm) at 4&#xB0;C using WX+ 100 Ultra Centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 75000100).</p>

        <title>2.4 Western blotting</title>
        <p>The Western blotting was employed to confirm protein expression level. Following the preparation of a lysate from cell culture using lysis buffer supplemented with radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Scientific, catalog no.89901) and protease inhibitor cocktail (100X) (Thermo Scientific, catalog no.1862209). The protein concentrations were determined using a Pierce&#x2122; bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit from (Thermo Scientific, catalog no.23325). Afterward, 25&#xA0;&#x3BC;g/&#x3BC;L of proteins were prepared using a 2x Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 1610737) and separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were run for 1&#x2013;2&#xA0;h at 100V. The protein samples were then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 10026934) using Trans-Blot<sup>&#xAE;</sup> Turbo&#x2122; machine (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 1704150). The membranes were blocked for 30&#xA0;min with 5% non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 1706404) at room temperature. Subsequently, the blots were incubated at 4&#xB0;C overnight) with primary antibodies, including PKD2-anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-28331) (diluted 1:1,000), GM3S-anti-rabbit (LSBio, catalog no.

        <p>The miRCURYTM RNA Isolation Kit (Exiqon Inc. Qiagen, catalog no. 300110) was used according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The primary cilia pellets were lysed with 50&#xA0;&#xB5;L of lysis solution and then vortexed for 15&#xA0;s. Subsequently, 50&#xA0;&#xB5;L of 96%&#x2013;100% ethanol was added to the lysate and mixed by vortexing for 10&#xA0;s. A total of 100&#xA0;&#xB5;L of the lysate with ethanol was applied onto the column provided with the kit and centrifuged for 1&#xA0;min at &gt;3,500 &#xD7; g. The resulting flowthrough was discarded, and the spin column was reassembled with its collection tube. A volume of 100&#xA0;&#xB5;L of washing solution was added to the column and centrifuged for 1&#xA0;min at 14,000 &#xD7; g. This washing step was repeated two additional times. The column was spun for 2&#xA0;min at 14,000 &#xD7; g to ensure thorough drying of the resin. Subsequently, 50&#xA0;&#xB5;L of elution buffer was added to the column, and it was centrifuged for 2&#xA0;min at 200 &#xD7; g, followed by 1&#xA0;min at 14,000 &#xD7; g.</p>

        <p>The Universal Real Time microRNA PCR Kit was used according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions to perform the qPCR. For each template RNA sample, the concentration was adjusted to 5&#xA0;ng/&#x3BC;L of total RNA. The reverse transcription reaction was prepared by mixing 2&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of 5x Reaction buffer, 4.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;L nuclease-free water, 1&#xA0;&#x3BC;L enzyme mix, 0.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;L synthetic RNA spike-ins, and 2&#xA0;&#x3BC;L of template total RNA (5&#xA0;ng/&#x3BC;L) to a total volume of 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;L. Then, the reaction was mixed by vortexing and incubated according to the following protocol: 42&#xB0;C for 60&#xA0;min, followed by heat-inactivation of the reverse transcriptase for at 95&#xB0;C for 5&#xA0;min; then, it was immediately cooled to 4&#xB0;C. After that, the cDNA was diluted 80 &#xD7; with RNase-free water before quantification by qRT-PCR. For miRNA quantification the miRCURY LNA&#x2122; Universal RT micro-RNA PCR system (QIAGEN, catalog. no. 203450) was used in combination with pre-designed primer for miR-17 (QIAGEN, catalog. no.

Expression of each micro-RNA was determined in duplicate at a final volume of 10&#xA0;&#x3BC;L per well, using the CFX manager 3.1 Software (Bio-Rad). The reaction conditions for polymerase activation/denaturation were as follows: 95&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 95&#xB0;C for 10&#xA0;s and 60&#xB0;C for 1&#xA0;min (ramp-rate 1.6&#xB0;C/s). The qPCR was performed using the C1000 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Analysis and fold differences were determined using the comparative C<sub>T</sub> method.

Then, the list of the protein interactions was further simplified by eliminating those proteins not closely or functionally associated with miR-17. For further confirmation, we loaded 16 proteins that interacted directly or indirectly with our proteins of interest, and they are as follows: PGRMC2, PKD2, GM3S, PTPRS, BMPR2, F11R, TMEM216, TUBA1A, ACTB, TFRC, ARL13B, FECH, UBC, NTRK1, UGCG, and TMEM231.

        <title>3.1 The miR-17 is localized to cilia and cell body</title>
        <p>Using unbiased proteomic studies, we most recently discovered five new membrane proteins localized in the cilia: bone morphogenetic type 2 (BMPR2), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTPRS), and progesterone receptor membrane component-2 (PGRMC2) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>). We first screened if the subcellular localization or expression of miR-17 in the cilia was altered by any of these new ciliary proteins. We established knockdown cells for each of the targets and compared them to control cells for the subcellular localization of miR-17 using quantitative <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (qISH) methodology. Efficacy for knockdown of the respective proteins were previously confirmed (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
        <p>The qISH was performed to identify the subcellular expression and location of miR-17. miR-17 expression levels in the cilia and cell body within the same cell were assessed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The miR-17 LNA&#x2122; probe was tagged with red fluorescence TEX615, primary cilia were identified with acetylated &#x3B1;-tubulin, and the nucleus was stained with DAPI. In all BMPR2, TfR1, JAM-A, PTPRS, and PGRMC2 knockdown cells, including scrambled control cells, miR-17 were observed to co-localize with cilia. miR-17 was also observed in the cytosol of all cells. Of note is that the presence of miR-17 in the cytosol might also be attributed to the fact that the probe could recognize the immature pre-miRNA within the nucleus (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ha and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Denli et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

        <p>The qISH is a more appropriate method to compare miR-17 subcellular localization in a cell within the same preparations due to a potential variability in hybridization efficiency between different preparations. Because the qISH was not an ideal method to compare total miR-17 among different knockdown cells, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure a more precise expression of miR-17. To do this, we first isolated the primary cilia by using shear force to break the cilia of the cell surface (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Sherpa et al., 2019</xref>).

To verify that the PGRMC2, GM3S, and PKD2 expressions remained repressed, we rigorously confirmed the integration of the shRNA reporter protein in the cells (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplement Figure 2A</xref>). The expression of the reporter green fluorescence protein (GFP) was confirmed in each knockdown condition. We also validated the expressions of PGRMC2 (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplement Figure 2B</xref>), GM3S (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplement Figure 2C</xref>), and PKD2 (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplement Figure 2D</xref>) using Western blots. The GAPDH and &#x3B2;-actin were used as loading controls. Analyses of the Western blots confirmed that the shRNAs significantly repressed the expression of PGRMC2 (26% &#xB1; 7%), GM3S (21% &#xB1; 10%), and PKD2 (5% &#xB1; 5%) (<xref rid="s10" ref-type="sec">Supplement Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

        <title>3.4 Cellular interactions of miR-17 with ciliary proteins</title>
        <p>To understand the significance of repressed miR-17 expression in PGRMC2 knockdown cells and miR-17 relevance in GM3S and PKD2 signaling, we also stably repressed the miR-17 expression with shRNA. Four different regions of silencing were used based on algorithm software prediction from OriGene company. The transfection efficiency of shRNA for each silencing sequence was determined through evaluating the expression of the GFP reporter integration in the cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Following transfection, transfected cells were cloned, subcloned, and cultured for several days. Subsequently, we selected the silencing sequence with the optimal knockdown efficiency among the four potential shRNA sequences, which was represented by positive GFP expression. The miR-17 knockdown was next quantified using RT-PCR analyses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Among all other sequences, shRNA-B sequence significantly reduced the levels of miR-17. The levels of miR-17 transfected with shRNA-A, shRNA-C, and shRNA-D were found to have no significant effect. Thus, shRNA-B sequence was selected for our studies as the most effective sequence based on the GFP expression and lower miR-17 expression in qPCR analysis.</p>

The rescue was done using transient approach via anti-sense of shRNA-B of miR-17.

Notably, the growth rate was significantly slower in miR-17 knockdown cells compared to control cells. This was because miR-17 knockdown cells when cultured at low density of 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells exhibited limited or no growth. However, these cells grew when seeding at 50% confluence, indicating that cell-cell interaction or communication might play a role in promoting their growth compared to when plated in very sparse conditions.

It is thus not surprising that ectopic expression of PGRMC2 alone in miR-17 knockdown cells did not rescue the cilia and cell cycle phenotypes, because miR-17 knockdown cells could potentially affect expressions of many other proteins in the network, in addition to PGRMC2, GM3S, or PKD2 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <title>4 Discussion</title>
      <p>Our present study aimed at exploring the association between miR-17 and primary cilia, focusing on their roles in cell division and related mechanisms. The subcellular localization of miR-17 was investigated using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, revealing its presence in the cell body and cilia. For the first time, we showed that ciliary compartment carrying a genetic material miR-17. Furthermore, the qISH demonstrated that cytosol expressed higher miR-17 compared to the cilium. Knockdown of PGRMC2 resulted in depressed miR-17 expression. In addition to PGRMC2, our studies also demonstrated that miR-17 had cellular interactions with other ciliary proteins, including GM3S and PKD2. Our data demonstrated that miR-17 was involved in cilia structure, cellular proliferation, and cell migration. Our study also proposed a potential interaction between miR-17 and ciliary proteins, including PGRMC2, GM3S, and PKD2.</p>
      <p>The subcellular localization of miR-17 within a cell could be attributed to the fact that subcellular compartments store and regulate genetic information (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Putnam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>). The observed decrease in miR-17 levels in PGRMC2 knockdown cells suggested that PGRMC2 played a critical role in regulating miR-17 expression. Moreover, PKD2knockdown increased miR-17 expression, suggesting potential negative feedback between miR-17 and PGRMC2, given that PKD2 could induce PGRMC2 expression. The cellular interactions among PGRMC2, GM3S, PKD2, and miR-17 were highlighting the complexity of their regulatory network within the cell. Our immunofluorescence studies revealed that miR-17 and its interacting proteins were involved in cilia formation, suggesting their importance for ciliogenesis and/or cilia maintenance. We observed an increase in proliferation in GM3S, PKD2, and miR-17 knockdown cells compared to control cells, while the cell migration assay showed a slower rate of wound closure in GM3S, PKD2, and miR-17 knockdown cells. This was because the relationship between cell proliferation and migration could be affected by several signaling pathways and cellular processes, such as GM3S/PKD2/miR-17 pathway. Moreover, the knockdown of ciliary proteins could modulate these pathways differently, resulting in contrasting effects in cell proliferation and migration.</p>
      <p>In our experience, the qPCR method was not the best approach to compare miR-17 levels between cell body and cilia for two reasons. First, after isolation, the cell body and cilia-isolated lysates were normalized with two different proteins: &#x3B2;-actin for cell body and acetylated-&#x3B1;-tubulin for cilia (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Second, as indicated in our Method section, we loaded RNA templates for both cell body and cilia at a concentration of 5&#xA0;ng/&#x3BC;L. It was obvious throughout our experiments that compared to cilia, cell body contained more total proteins and RNAs. For this reason, our initial comparisons between cilia and cell body were carried out using <italic>in situ</italic> approach, in which the cell and cilia were all treated and analyzed at the same conditions.</p>
      <p>In certain cancer cell types, the loss of primary cilia was observed (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2020</xref>). While cilia were expressed in normal kidney and prostate cancer cells (PC3), their absence was observed in both prostate cancer cells (DU145) and lung cancer epithelial cells (NL 20). Interestingly, while cilia were found in PC3, the percentage was significantly lower than that observed in normal kidney cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, we measured the cilia length in PGRMC2 knockdown cells. The cilia length of PGRMC2 knockdown cells was significantly decreased compared to the control cells.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed a normal percentage of ciliated cells in PGRMC2 knockdown cells compared to control cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that there was a consistent effect on cilia presence. Consistent with the previous studies, our research also confirmed that knockdown of PKD2 led to a significant increase in proliferation compared to control. Likewise, our results were consistent with those reported by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al. (2020)</xref>, who also observed hyper-proliferation in cells with PKD2 knockdown cells compared to control cells. This supported the proliferative role of PKD2 like those examined in our studies.</p>
      <p>A previous study reported a significant decrease in the rate of wound closure in PGRMC2 knockdown cells compared to controls (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mohieldin et al., 2020</xref>). This discrepancy from our current study could arise from variations in experimental conditions between the two studies. Our study utilized cell culture media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), while the previous study did not use any FBS. Serum starvation could induce cellular stress responses and change the cell behavior differently from cells subjected to media-containing serum. Serum media provided critical nutrients and growth factors that promoted cell proliferation and migration, while serum deprivation activated adaptive cellular responses that conserved energy to avoid nutrient deficiency. Serum-deprived cells might exhibit differing in migratory behaviors compared to those maintained in serum-containing media (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmadiankia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Raut et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>Recent data confirm that miRNAs might also regulate several numbers of cell cycle regulators to regulate cell proliferation (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bueno and Malumbres, 2011</xref>). Dysregulation of miRNAs could contribute to proliferative disorders, including cancer, by altering the levels of critical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The use of miR-17 mimics promoted the proliferation through decreasing apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, miR-17 expression levels were upregulated in the clinical samples from gastric cancer patients. The overexpression of PGRMC2 represses entry into the cell cycle (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), decreases the migration rates of cancer cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Albrecht et al., 2012</xref>), and induces apoptosis (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2023</xref>). The overexpression of PKD2 rescues cells from stress-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brill et al., 2020</xref>). The miR-17 overexpression increases cell proliferation (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brill et al., 2020</xref>). Of note is that when PKD2 was knockdown, we saw an increase in miR-17 expression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with this idea (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brill et al., 2020</xref>), we saw an increase in cell proliferation when miR-17 was overexpressed via PKD2 knockdown (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>While our study showed significant effects of GM3S/PKD2/PGRMC2/miR-17 on ciliary dynamics and cellular proliferation, we did not explore a broader molecular pathway or signaling mechanism underlying these observations. Further investigation is warranted to fully understand the complex relationship among GM3S/PKD2/PGRMC2/miR-17 signaling, primary cilia, and cellular proliferation. Future studies should also explore potential correlations between primary cilia and other signaling pathways, such as the MAPK pathway and others, which were involved in cancer progression (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2020</xref>). Elucidating these pathways and their interactions with primary cilia and miR-17 would provide better insights into the mechanism on how miR-17 regulated cell proliferation through primary cilia, leading to a better understanding of ciliopathies and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.</p>
      <p>We propose a potential pathway based on a network of ciliary proteins (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). While the network suggests a complex interaction among GM3S/PKD2/PGRMC2/miR-17, the Western blot confirmed the functional interactions among GM3S/PKD2/PGRMC2/miR-17, as shown in (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The miR-17 regulates expression levels of PGRMC2, GM3S, and PKD2. PKD2 suppresses miR-17 expression while increases the expression of PGRMC2 and GM3S. PGRMC2 elevates miR-17 and GM3S expressions but does not seem to influence PKD2 expression. Likewise, GM3S promotes miR-17 and PGRMC2 expressions without affecting PKD2. To sum up, the intermolecular relationship between miR-17 and the ciliary proteins PGRMC2, GM3S, and PKD2 involves a complex network of different regulatory interactions, which might involve microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation and possible protein-protein interactions or signaling pathways. Further study is required to examine the exact mechanisms and functional effects of these interactions.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, our studies demonstrated for the first time that the ciliary compartment carries a genetic material miR-17. This study provided novel insights into the complex relationship between miR-17, primary cilia, and cellular processes such as proliferation and migration. The findings suggested that miR-17 and ciliary proteins PGRMC2, GM3S, and PKD2 played crucial roles in regulating cilia dynamics and cellular behaviors.</p>
