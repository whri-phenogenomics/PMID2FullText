        <p id="Par1">We describe the first cases of germline biallelic null mutations in ARPC5, part of the Arp2/3 actin nucleator complex, in two unrelated patients presenting with recurrent and severe infections, early-onset autoimmunity, inflammation, and dysmorphisms. This defect compromises multiple cell lineages and functions, and when protein expression is reestablished in-vitro, the Arp2/3 complex conformation and functions are rescued. As part of the pathophysiological evaluation, we also show that interleukin (IL)&#x2212;6 signaling is distinctively impacted in this syndrome. Disruption of IL-6 classical but not trans-signaling highlights their differential roles in the disease and offers perspectives for therapeutic molecular targets.</p>

Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 (ARPC5) is part of the ubiquitously expressed Arp2/3 complex, an actin nucleator involved in multiple cellular processes including cell movement, vesicle trafficking, and receptor endocytosis. This complex is composed of seven subunits: actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2 and Arp3) and actin-related protein complex subunits 1&#x2013;5, two of which exist in 2 isoforms encoded by paralogous genes (ARPC1A, ARPC1B, ARPC2, ARPC3, ARPC4, ARPC5, and ARPC5L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Germline mutations disrupting several proteins that interact with the Arp2/3 complex are known causes of IEI, including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

She was born at 41 weeks gestation with intrauterine growth restriction. P1 became symptomatic within the first months of life with gastrointestinal and respiratory tract bleeding, hepatosplenomegaly, Evans syndrome (autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia) and neutrophilia. Her clinical course was remarkable for respiratory tract complications including recurrent/severe viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pneumatoceles; eczema; juvenile dermatomyositis-like focal myositis; delayed wound healing; recurrent episodes of paralytic ileus; celiac disease; hepatitis; minimal change disease nephropathy; short stature, facial dysmorphisms and scoliosis. Multiple autoantibodies were detected at various timepoints of her life; acute phase reactants, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), were persistently elevated. Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments (e.g., steroids, rituximab, and high dose intravenous immunoglobulins) were used with partial and unsustained success. At 15 years of age, she died after a sudden episode of hemoptysis and hematochezia; an autopsy was not performed.

She became symptomatic since early in life when she presented with omphalitis. Her clinical course was remarkable for respiratory tract complications including severe/recurrent bacterial infections and pneumatoceles as well as skin infections, poor wound healing, multifocal aseptic bone lesions, and scoliosis. Neurodevelopmental delay, spasticity and brain atrophy were also evidenced. Acute phase reactants were persistently elevated. At the age of one year, she died because of progressive neurologic and respiratory disease; an autopsy was not performed. Cells from P2 were not available for research studies. P2&#x2019;s elder sister presented with severe, invasive bacterial infections (i.e., <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) since the neonatal period; hepatosplenomegaly and hematochezia were also present, but no neurologic manifestations were observed. The patient died at six months of age due to progressive perineal necrotic infectious complications; an autopsy was not performed. Biospecimens from this patient were not available for testing.</p>

        <p id="Par8">While the mutant <italic>ARPC5</italic> mRNA was detected (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>), expression of ARPC5 was not detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), T-cell blasts, and fibroblasts from P1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). N-terminus truncated proteins, resulting from alternative transcription initiation sites were not detected either. The heterozygous parents showed intermediate expression levels of ARPC5. Immunoblotting of the other Arp2/3 complex subunits revealed reduced expression of ARPC1A and ARPC1B in P1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). ARPC5 expression was found to be normal in two patients with ARPC1B deficiency (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Formation of Arp2/3 complexes was quantitatively and qualitatively impaired in P1. Arp2/3 complexes containing ARPC5 were not present in P1 but were detected in HC fibroblasts lysates.

        <p id="Par9">Immunofluorescence microscopy evaluation of P1&#x2019;s early adherent fibroblasts revealed a high number of filopodia (elongated, finger-like actin protrusions), whereas HC cells predominantly formed lamellipodia (flat, sheet-like actin projections) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Continuous impedance monitoring of P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts showed lower spreading speed compared to HC&#x2019;s cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Treatment of HC&#x2019;s fibroblasts with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 resulted in reduced spreading capacity mimicking P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts behavior (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). A similar pattern of aberrant spreading characterized by enrichment of filopodia and absence of lamellipodia was observed in P1&#x2019;s neutrophils (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>, and Supplementary Movie&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Real-time sequential imaging revealed that P1&#x2019;s cells covered a smaller area over time compared to HC&#x2019;s neutrophils (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Cell motility was assessed in P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts via a time course wound healing assay. P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts were slower than HC&#x2019;s cells to close the in-vitro wound gap (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Migration of neutrophils was assessed in response to N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF). Directed migration was severely impaired in P1&#x2019;s neutrophils, as no cells were able to complete migration during the observation period, unlike HC&#x2019;s cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and Supplementary Movie&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Mutant ARPC5 functional studies.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Fibroblasts from patient 1 (P1) and a healthy control (HC) were seeded on a retronectin-coated surface and fixed after 20&#x2009;min.

        <title>Clinical phenotype, IL-6 signaling and molecular targeting</title>
        <p id="Par12">P1 (and to some extent P2, despite her young age) presented with clinical features resembling both <italic>STAT3</italic> dominant-negative (DN; Job&#x2019;s syndrome) and <italic>STAT3</italic> gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. While P1&#x2019;s facial dysmorphism, eczema, bacterial -<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>- and fungal -<italic>Candida</italic> spp., <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>- pneumonias, poor wound healing, pneumatoceles, and scoliosis were suggestive of a Job&#x2019;s-like syndrome; her short stature, skin manifestations, autoimmune cytopenia -Coombs+ autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia-, celiac disease, autoimmune endocrinopathies -hypothyroidism-, and autoimmune hepatitis were suggestive of a STAT3 GOF-like phenotype. When her cytokine responses to IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-21, interferon (IFN)&#x3B1; and IFN&#x3B3; were evaluated in T cells and monocytes, no abnormalities were detected (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Other T-cell functions such as TCR rearrangement, signaling, and microcluster formation were normal in P1&#x2019;s T-cell blasts (Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). TCR signaling and migration were also normal in CRISPR/Cas9 generated <italic>ARPC5</italic>-knockout Jurkat cells (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). However, signaling through IL-6, primarily dependent on STAT3 and to a lesser extent on STAT1, was markedly diminished. Phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to in-vitro IL-6 stimulation was nearly absent in P1&#x2019;s CD4+ T cells yet was present in response to IL-21 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). When the expression of cell surface IL-6 receptor complex (IL-6RC) components IL-6R&#x3B1; and gp130 were evaluated, very low levels of IL-6R&#x3B1; were detected, while gp130 expression was mildly reduced (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). When IL-6RC signaling was tested in P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts, response to IL-6 was also nearly absent, while gp130-dependent/IL-6R&#x3B1;-independent responses to oncostatin-M and IL-11 were fully preserved (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Treatment of healthy controls&#x2019; CD4+ T cells with CK-666 resulted in a reduction of ~21% in the surface expression of IL-6R&#x3B1;, and a 1.4-fold increase in soluble IL-6R&#x3B1; when compared to the vehicle treated samples (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>), suggesting that the actin defect was indeed contributing to the impaired IL-6R&#x3B1; surface&#xA0;expression levels. The levels of transcription for both membrane-bound IL-6R&#x3B1; and soluble IL-6R&#x3B1; were not affected by treatment with CK-666 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>). As P1 had consistently elevated CRP levels, a known IL-6-dependent readout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that trans-signaling, an alternative model to IL-6 classical signaling reliant on the soluble form of IL-6R&#x3B1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, was likely enhanced. While a clinical serum cytokine panel showed modest elevation of IL-6 (29.48&#x2009;pg/mL, within 85&#x2013;97.5% of normal distribution), we found markedly increased levels of both soluble IL-6R&#x3B1; (sIL-6R&#x3B1;) and sIL-6R&#x3B1; complexed with IL-6 in P1&#x2019;s plasma (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). When tested in-vitro, P1&#x2019;s CD4+ T cells and fibroblasts were able to phosphorylate STAT3 in response to an IL-6/IL-6R&#x3B1; fusion protein, known as hyper-IL6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> and&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par13">Herein we describe two unrelated patients with a previously undescribed IEI associated with germline biallelic null mutations in <italic>ARPC5</italic>. The patients presented with recurrent and severe infections, early-onset autoimmunity, inflammation, and dysmorphisms. In addition, we show how ARPC5-dependent actin disruption can impact IL-6 signaling, that can be considered as a therapeutic molecular target for this disease.</p>
      <p id="Par14">Genetically, ARPC5 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with no evidence of haploinsufficiency (i.e., heterozygous parents were asymptomatic); while clinical penetrance seems complete (i.e., both individuals with biallelic mutations were symptomatic), more patients will have to be described to fully confirm disease penetrance and expressivity.</p>
      <p id="Par15">We demonstrated that ARPC5 expression was lost in patient cells, resulting in lower expression of interacting proteins ARPC1B and ARPC1A, but not of other Arp2/3 complex components. The dependence of ARPC1 isoforms on ARPC5 levels has been previously shown in HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and is now confirmed in human disease. In contrast, ARPC1B deficiency does not seem to affect ARPC5 expression levels, suggesting that ARPC5 deficiency might have a broader impact on biology and disease. Moreover, depletion of ARPC1B levels in the patient with ARPC5 deficiency supports the phenotypic overlaps between the two diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par16">Functionally, the Arp2/3 complex is recognized by its unique ability to nucleate actin filaments at an angle from a preexisting filament, resulting in a branched network of polymerized actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Branched actin is the predominant form of actin organization in lamellipodia, podosomes and invadopodia, all required but not indispensable for cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Experimental disruption of the Arp2/3 complex results in abrogation of lamellipodial structures with enrichment of filopodia, as confirmed in P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts and neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Similarly defective actin distribution patterns have been documented in platelets, neutrophils, and T cells from patients with ARPC1B deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, as well as in patients with HEM-1 deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a protein required to activate the Arp2/3 complex to generate lamellipodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par17">We showed that fibroblast migration was impaired in ARPC5 deficiency. This finding correlated with the poor and delayed wound healing experienced by our patients. Impaired wound healing was also observed with in-vitro testing of murine <italic>Arpc3</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and <italic>Arpc5</italic>-silenced rat smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, migration of fibroblasts from a patient with ARPC1B deficiency was unaffected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, suggesting that not all Arp2/3-related defects behave as phenocopies in the same cell lineage and function. Moreover, while fibroblast defects are certainly contributing to the wound healing defect, they are unlikely to be the only cause: the hyperinflammatory state and impaired neutrophil migration, both seen in other PID/IEI with impaired wound healing, must be considered as other likely responsible factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par18">Thrombocytopenia in ARPC5 deficiency is probably another multifactorial complication in this disease. Despite peripheral blood thrombocytopenia, bone marrow biopsies on P1 never showed increased megakaryocytes but did present with dysplastic features, similarly to what was reported in patients with ARPC1B deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, which is also markedly diminished in ARPC5 deficiency. Her persistent hepatosplenomegaly and broad autoimmunity profile may have also potentially contributed to platelet sequestration and thrombocytopenia.</p>
      <p id="Par19">Although quantitatively decreased and qualitatively altered, the assembly of Arp2/3 complexes was not completely abrogated in the context of ARPC5 deficiency. The same was seen in platelet lysates from patients with ARPC1B deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and likely contribute to the non-embryonic lethality of these genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Whether Arp2/3 complex integrity in these scenarios is maintained by alternative isoforms of ARPC1 (as reported by Leung et al.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and ARPC5, or by non-canonical conformations of the complex lacking these subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, is yet to be established. Of note, different compositions of the Arp2/3 complex have been shown to nucleate actin with distinct efficiency and to present variable stability. Specific combinations of the complex are likely suited to particular physiologic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In this setting, Faessler et al., very recently reported how murine and rat ArpC5 subunit isoforms (i.e., Arpc5 and Arpc5L) can alternatively and differently regulate particular Arp2/3-dependant functions. Interestingly, some differences became evident between human vs. rodent species as ARPC5 deficiency in our work does not seem to affect ARPC5L accumulation, while ArpC5 deficiency consistently increased the ArpC5L levels likely affecting the functions dependent on each type of Arp2/3 complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Not surprisingly, the data presented here showed that depriving cells of the ARPC5 subunit resulted in dysregulation of several but not all Arp2/3-dependent functions. Altogether, these features help to explain why signaling through IL-6R&#x3B1; but not all surface-expressed cytokine receptors are affected by ARPC5 deficiency. Interestingly, in depth analysis of the impact of ARPC5 deficiency on other T-cell functions failed to detect deleterious consequences as previously demonstrated in ARPC1B deficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par20">Despite the inherent limitations of studying rare diseases with small number of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we showed that two unrelated patients carrying biallelic null mutations in <italic>ARPC5</italic> suffered from a previously unreported disease. While the association between ARPC5 deficiency and CNS or other syndromic manifestations will be further clarified as more patients are described, we efficiently proved that the ARPC5 protein was not expressed, Arp2/3 complex formation was impaired, and subsequently different actin-related functions were variably affected in specific cell lineages in this disease. Rescue of ARPC5 expression reestablished Arp2/3 complex conformation and function. As part of the clinical-pathophysiological evaluation, we also showed that the IL-6 pathway was distinctively impacted in this disease. IL-6 signaling was tested, trans-signaling seemed to have a critical role in the disease and offered a molecular target for treatment. This work emphasizes the importance of studying rare genetic diseases through rigorous methodological criteria to unveil the underlying pathophysiology mechanism and potential therapeutic opportunities.</p>

A12379), mouse anti-HA (Cell Signaling technology, Cat. 2367), or rabbit anti-Flag (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. 14793&#x2009;S) antibodies. Next, cells were washed in PBS. Samples stained with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies were incubated for 1&#x2009;h with Alexa Fluor 594 or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer (Invitrogen, Cat. A11072 and A21069). After washes, all samples were incubated with DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. 4083) in PBS, for 10&#x2009;min. Samples were washed twice in PBS and ready for imaging. Filopodia formation was best visualized 20&#x2009;min after cell seeding and lamellipodia formation 120&#x2009;min after cell seeding; therefore, those time points were selected for imaging. Images were collected using a ZOE fluorescent cell imager (Bio-Rad).</p>

        <title>Real-time cell analysis of adhesion and spreading</title>
        <p id="Par28">The rate and magnitude of adherence of fibroblasts was measured with the xCELLigence RTCA MP (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, E-plates 96 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) were background normalized after equilibrating the wells with 100&#x2009;&#xB5;L of complete media for 30&#x2009;min. Following this step, 1&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>4</sup> HC&#x2019;s or P1&#x2019;s fibroblasts were seeded and immediately placed onto the xCELLigence RTCA MP machine at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to begin recording impedance every 1&#x2013;2&#x2009;min for 5&#x2009;h and every 15&#x2009;min thereafter. Impedance values were converted into the cell index by the RTCA software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and plotted over time using the GraphPad Prism software version 8.3.0 (GraphPad, LLC). To measure spreading of neutrophils, isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (1&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 20&#x2009;&#xB5;L HBSS with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer (Gibco, Cat. 14025134) were added on the center of microscope slide. A coverslip was placed over the cells and digital images were captured at five second intervals for 600&#x2009;s. The area and perimeter of the cells were measured using Infinity Analyze software (Lumenera, version 5.0.3).</p>

        <title>Cell migration assays</title>
        <p id="Par29">Fibroblasts migration was assessed with a wound healing (scratch) assay. Fibroblasts were seeded in a 12-well plate and serum-starved overnight. The next day, a scratch in the cell monolayer was generated with a pipette tip (20&#x2009;&#x3BC;l tip, tip width 0.94&#x2009;mm, Thermo Scientific Art tips). Cells were washed 2x in PBS and from then on cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were imaged right after scratching (t&#x2009;=&#x2009;0), at 8&#x2009;h, and 24&#x2009;h after the scratch was made. Images were captured with a Lionheart FX Automated Live Cell Imager (Agilent BioTeK) using a 4&#xD7; objective with the high contrast brightfield accessory. To improve visualization, digital phase contrast processing was applied to entire images using Gen5 Image+ software (Agilent BioTeK). Neutrophil chemotaxis was monitored across a 260&#x2009;&#xB5;m platform separating the &#x201C;cell&#x201D; well from the &#x201C;chemoattractant&#x201D; well using the EZ-TAXIScan (Effector Cell Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Isolated neutrophils (5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>3</sup> cells in 1.0&#x2009;&#xB5;l) were added to the &#x201C;cell&#x201D; well of the EZ-TAXIScan and 1.0&#x2009;&#xB5;l of either buffer (0.1% BSA in RPMI, 20&#x2009;mM HEPES) or 5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2212;8&#x2009;</sup>M fMLF (N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. F3506) was added to the opposing &#x201C;chemoattractant&#x201D; well. Digital images of the migrating PMNs were captured every 30&#x2009;s for 1&#x2009;h. Images were converted to stacks using the ImageJ software (version 1.53t; NIH). Ten randomly selected cells were electronically traced using the ImageJ plug-in, MTrackJ and the sequential positional coordinates of individual migrating cells were determined as a function of time. The tracks of individual migrating cells were reconstructed and plotted with the position of each cell anchored at the origin at t&#x2009;=&#x2009;0. Since data were collected with time and position, multiple parameters could be derived &#x2013; overall distance, directed distance (parallel to the chemoattractant, random distance (orthogonal to the chemoattractant), overall velocity, directed and random velocity vectors, and time-to-event analysis (number of cells completing migration and elapsed time). To assess migration in Jurkat cells, 5&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>5</sup> wild-type (WT) or <italic>ARPC5</italic>-KO cells were suspended in 100&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS (RPMI complete). The cells were loaded into 5.0 &#x3BC;m Transwell inserts (Corning) which were placed onto 24-well plates containing 450&#x2009;&#x3BC;L of RPMI complete with or without 800&#x2009;ng/mL CXCL12 (Peprotech). After 3&#x2009;h of incubation at 37&#x2009;&#xB0;C, cells that had migrated to the lower chamber were collected and counted using an automatic cell counter (Countess II FL, ThermoFisher Scientific). Results were calculated as percentage of cells that had migrated out of total input cells.</p>
