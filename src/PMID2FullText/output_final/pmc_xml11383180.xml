      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Human hair, especially human scalp hair, has important ornamental functions that are essential for social communication and sense of well-being. Unwanted hair loss poses psychosocial distress to affected individuals and affects their quality of life (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). A comprehensive survey conducted on individuals with hair loss revealed that they are more prone to experiencing anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Additionally, a concerning increase in suicide rates has been found among individuals suffering from hair loss (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Congenital hypotrichosis (HYPT) is a hair disorder marked by sparse or complete absence of hair on the scalp and/or other body parts. Occasionally, some cases accompanied by tightly coiled, curled, or woolly hair are called autosomal recessive woolly hair (ARWH) or autosomal dominant woolly hair (ADWH) depending on their congenital pattern (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Keratin</italic> (KRT) <italic toggle="yes">74</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRT71</italic> mutations are known to cause nonsyndromic ADWH1 (OMIM#613981) and ADWH2 (OMIM#615896), respectively (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Nevertheless, the causative genes for several affected individuals are still unidentified, and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully comprehended.</p>
      <p><underline>A</underline><underline>d</underline>isintegrin and <underline>a</underline><underline>m</underline>etalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17), a type I transmembrane metallopeptidase, is responsible for shedding the ectodomains of over 90 substrates, including cytokines (such as TNF-&#x3B1;), cytokine receptors (such as IL-6R and TNFR), and adhesion proteins (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It functions as a molecular switch to regulate both inflammation and tissue regeneration and is linked to various inflammatory diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, inflammation-related atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In addition, there is compelling evidence supporting the critical involvement of ADAM17 in many cancers and as a potential therapeutic target (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Even though ADAM17 can cleave multiple substrates in vitro or in cell-free assays, only some of them have a substantial impact on development and disease in vivo. For instance, in skin, deletion of ADAM17 in keratinocytes stimulates atopic dermatitis, driven by Th2 and/or Th17 response(s), due to a selective hindrance in the recruitment of the transcription factor c-Fos to the Th2-polarizing cytokine TSLP (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). ADAM17 regulates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand-dependent terminal keratinocyte differentiation, thus preserving the skin barrier (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additionally, ADAM17 is also involved in the development of the hair follicle inner root sheath (IRS) and the establishment of hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) niche (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Further exploration is necessary to fully understand the impact of ADAM17 on hair follicle development.</p>
      <p>Tripartite motif-containing protein 47 (TRIM47) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is involved in numerous biological processes, including tumorigenesis, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and endothelial inflammation (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The interaction between E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein is a core step in ubiquitin&#x2013;proteasome system&#x2013;mediated protein degradation (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). TRIM47 aggravates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). TRIM47 promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SMAD4, FBP1, and PKC-&#x3B5;/PKD3 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Nevertheless, the pathologic and clinical roles of TRIM47 in hair follicles remain unclear.</p>
      <p>In this study, we identified that a variant in the conserved ADAM17 dynamic interaction sequence (CANDIS) domain of <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> caused autosomal dominant hypotrichosis with woolly hair. An <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic>-knockin mouse model mimicked the hair abnormality in patients. We discovered that TRIM47, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacted with the mutant ADAM17, promoting its ubiquitination and ultimate protein degradation. Eventually, reduced ADAM17 expression led to dysfunction in the Notch signaling pathway, which in turn contributed to hair follicle malformation.</p>

        <title>ADAM17 variant leads to autosomal dominant hypotrichosis with woolly hair.</title>
        <p>We conducted a study on a Chinese family consisting of 7 patients with generalized hypotrichosis and curly hair. The majority of affected individuals exhibited tightly curled and sparse hair either at birth or during the early stage of infancy. The men exhibited varying degrees of hypotrichosis, often displaying fragile and thin scalp hair. Notably, they also had woolly hair and patchy hair loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, axilla, and body. Hair growth tended to be limited, at a rate of 1&#x2013;2 cm since birth throughout their lifetime, leading to complete hair loss as they aged. Conversely, women presented milder symptoms in comparison with men, often showing only woolly hair and punctate or flaky alopecia (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). No abnormalities were detected concerning their skin, nails, teeth, or sweating. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of scalp sections exhibited a marked reduction in hair follicle counts, with minimal inflammatory infiltration observed around hair follicles (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of healthy individuals&#x2019; hair revealed a consistent ceramic tile&#x2013;like arrangement of hair cuticles, whereas a patient&#x2019;s hair displayed longitudinal grooves and cleavages. Moreover, the patient&#x2019;s hair exhibited irregular transverse sections and widespread exfoliation of the hair cuticle (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The provided pedigree offered persuasive evidence supporting the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for the phenotypes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To identify potential pathogenic variants associated with hypotrichosis causative genes like <italic toggle="yes">KRT74</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRT25</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRT71</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">APCDD1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">RPL21</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SNRPE</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDSN</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">U2HR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">EPS8L3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DSG4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LIPH</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LPAR6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DSC3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRT25</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LSS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">TTMP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRT86</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRT83</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">KRT81</italic>, gene panel sequencing was used. However, the variant search yielded no results. We performed a genome-wide linkage analysis approach using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found evidence for linkage to chromosome 2 with a maximum log of the likelihood odds ratio (LOD) score of 3.18 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Subsequently, we narrowed down the candidate region to 19.6 cM, between markers rs979290 and rs57254657, which encompassed 126 annotated genes, through genotyping of markers in the identified region (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.177588DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.177588DS1</ext-link>). We conducted whole-exome sequencing on an affected family member (II:4), screening all variants in the critical region, and detected a heterozygous missense mutation c.1939G&gt;A (p.Asp647Asn) in the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> gene (NM_003183). Upon conducting Sanger sequencing on all family members, we identified that the mutation was detected only in affected family members (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). All identified variants were absent from public databases (1,000 Genomes, ClinVar, Ensembl, and gnomAD) and 600 healthy controls.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, ADAM17 is predominantly expressed in the hair cortex, IRS, and outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicle (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Aspartic residue at position 647 is located within the CANDIS domain of ADAM17, which is highly conserved and plays a vital role in protein interactions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1, H and I</xref>).</p>

        <title>Adam17 (p.D647N) mutant mouse model mimics hair loss in HYPT.</title>
        <p>In order to ascertain whether the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation is pathogenic, we constructed and <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> (p.D647N) knockin mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>, A and B). Homozygous mice (Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup>) were distinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous littermates (Adam17<sup>D647N/+</sup>) by their abnormal hair characteristics, including wavy vibrissa hair and a thinner, wavy, gray coat (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These distinctive features first appeared shortly after birth and gradually worsened as the mice aged (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Four hair follicle types with varying shapes and sizes emerged during hair development in the dorsal skin of mice, including guard (primary), auchene and awl (secondary), and zigzag (tertiary) hairs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Compared with the wild-type, Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> pelages exhibited a reduction in primary and secondary hairs but a significant increase in the proportion of zigzag hairs. All 4 hair types in the Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> pelage displayed waviness, disorganized medulla, and irregular melanin piles (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, SEM revealed irregular and broken scales, suggesting a defect in the hair cuticle (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>HE staining showed that Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice exhibited a diminished count of hair follicles and abnormal hair architecture at the first anagen (P7) and the second anagen (P28) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, D and E</xref>). Hair follicles in wild-type mice exhibited distinctive concentric layers, namely ORS, companion layer, IRS (Henle&#x2019;s layer, Huxley&#x2019;s layer, and cuticle), and hair shaft (cuticle, cortex, and medulla). However, the concentric structure of hair follicles in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice was disrupted, along with a disturbed distribution of cells in the IRS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, hair shafts in the Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice displayed irregularities and deformities, suggesting a potential role for ADAM17 in hair shaft development (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Immunofluorescence demonstrated that IRS labeled by Gata3 and hair cortex keratins labeled by the AE13 antibody were markedly diminished in the hair follicles of Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice. Conversely, there was a noticeably increased expression of K5, which functioned as a pivotal marker for ORS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, Ki67 immunostaining revealed a decreased cell proliferation ability in hair germ of Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). These observations were supported by Western blotting (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2, G and H</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that hair follicles in wild-type mice exhibited distinctive concentric layers, while all layers apart from the hair shaft and IRS cuticle of hair follicles in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice were indistinguishable (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Overall, these results suggested that the p.D647N mutation in <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> had a substantial impact on the proper organization of hair follicles.</p>
        <p>During the weaning period, Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice exhibited a distinguishable shiny, red, and semitransparent skin phenotype. Subsequently, at P15, a notable incidence of erythroderma developed along with a substantial amount of desquamation (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3D</xref>). Ultimately, this affliction resolved spontaneously in the subsequent days. Additionally, Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice experienced notable developmental retardation within the first 4 months (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3E</xref>). Remarkably, these mice displayed edema in their extremities and a significantly high mortality rate during the peri-weaning period (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, no discernible anomalies were detected in the fur or skin of Adam17<sup>D647N/+</sup> mice as per our observation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Disruption of HFSCs in Adam17-mutant mice contributes to the woolly hair and alopecia phenotype.</title>
        <p>To further explore whether HFs in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice are defective in forming new hair, we shaved hair and monitored the appearance of skin pigmentation. Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice exhibited a delayed onset of anagen in a partial area of dorsal skin compared with their wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, A and B</xref>). This observation suggested that the <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation hindered hair regeneration. HFs generate a new bulge beside the old one and persist to the next cycle in the telogen phase, which is called club hair (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). HE staining demonstrated a remarkable decrease of 2-bulge HFs in telogen phase (P63) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C and D</xref>). CD34 and K15 are specifically expressed in the inner and outer layers of the club hair, respectively, and are commonly used to label HFSCs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The whole-mount immunostaining against CD34 and K15 revealed that wild-type HFs developed a 2-bulge architecture, whereas Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice usually had only 1 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel, and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, E and F</xref>).</p>
        <p>At telogen, both wild-type and mutant bulge cells consisted of an &#x3B1;6 integrin&#x2013;rich (ITGA6-rich) basal layer and an ITGA6-low suprabasal layer, both of which were CD34<sup>+</sup>. Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> follicles displayed fewer CD34<sup>+</sup> bulge cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) than wild-type follicles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> follicles displayed lower Ki67 positivity than wild-type follicles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Immunofluorescence of CD200, the marker of secondary hair germ, verified a decreased differentiation of HFSCs in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice at early stage of anagen (P21) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Taken together, we find that the <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation leads to HFSC abnormalities.</p>

        <title>ADAM17 mutation decreases its protein stability owing to enhanced auto-ubiquitination.</title>
        <p>To elucidate the potential impact of the p.D647N mutation on ADAM17, we analyzed its expression in humans and mouse samples. Notably, our investigations revealed a significant reduction of ADAM17 protein levels in affected individuals compared with healthy controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A and B</xref>), though we did not observe any significant differences in <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Correspondingly, we observed a decrease in the protein level of Adam17, instead of mRNA levels, in hair follicles of Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, D&#x2013;F</xref>). We postulated that this might be attributable to the differential stability of 2 proteins, as mRNA levels could not account for the difference in protein levels. To investigate the stabilities of 2 proteins, we stably overexpressed wild-type and mutant ADAM17 in HaCaT cells, an immortalized human keratinocyte line. Cycloheximide chase assays results indicated that the mutant ADAM17 displayed a shorter half-life compared with the wild-type counterpart (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Subsequently, we treated HaCaT cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Our findings revealed that MG132, but not CQ, deterred the reduction of the mutant ADAM17 protein level relative to the wild-type counterpart, suggesting that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway was involved in the further degradation of the mutant ADAM17 expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, H and I</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>, C and E). Additionally, we verified that <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation decreased its protein stability via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in primary cultured fibroblasts from wild-type and Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>, B, D, and F). Indeed, hyperubiquitination of mutant ADAM17 was observed in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). In summary, our findings indicate that the mutant ADAM17 displays elevated auto-ubiquitination levels, ultimately leading to decreased protein stability and lower abundance.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, we evaluated the shedding activity of ADAM17 in human skin tissue, as well as in primary cultured mouse skin fibroblast cells and HaCaT cells. Our findings indicated a significant reduction in ADAM17 shedding activity in the skin tissue of patients and primary cultured mouse skin fibroblast cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>, A and B). This reduction may be attributed to a decrease in the expression of ADAM17 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, A&#x2013;C</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). It is worth noting that we overexpressed wild-type and mutant ADAM17 in HaCaT cells and observed no significant difference in shedding activity between the 2 groups at identical ADAM17 expression levels (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> variant does not impact its shedding activity.</p>

        <title>ADAM17 mutation reinforces the bond between ADAM17 and its specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM47.</title>
        <p>E3 ubiquitin ligases exhibit substrate specificity by selectively binding to target proteins, which results in their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation causing reduced protein stability, we set out to identify its E3 ubiquitin ligase by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) coupled with mass spectrometry. Through in-depth bioinformatic analysis of potential ADAM17-binding proteins identified, we located RING-E3 ligase TRIM47 as a potential interactor of ADAM17 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, A and B</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). We validated the direct interaction between ADAM17 and TRIM47 using co-IP and pulldown assay (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, C and D</xref>). The endogenous association between Adam17 and Trim47 was then verified by co-IP assay in the epidermal tissue lysates of mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Confocal immunofluorescence revealed that Adam17 and Trim47 were colocalized in HaCaT cells, primary cultured mouse skin fibroblasts, and HFs of mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, F&#x2013;H</xref>). Moreover, TRIM47 showed high expression in HFSCs (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation strengthened the association between ADAM17 and TRIM47, verifying the mass spectrometry results (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, B&#x2013;G</xref>). Subsequent to the aforementioned validation of direct interaction between ADAM17 and TRIM47, we probed the effect of knockdown/overexpression of TRIM47 in mutant ADAM17 HaCaT cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6B</xref>). Our results indicated that knockdown of TRIM47 impaired the degradation of the mutant ADAM17 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), while overexpression of TRIM47 accentuated degradation of the mutant ADAM17 (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6C</xref>). These results indicate that <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation reinforces the bond between ADAM17 and TRIM47, ultimately resulting in a reduced protein stability.</p>
        <p>A computational 3D complex structural model by ZDock based on the x-ray crystal structure from the Protein Data Bank was further generated (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, left panel). Docking simulation data from the model demonstrated that amino acids D597, K626, D636, K640, D647, D657, L659, N671, and I672 of ADAM17 form a &#x201C;hairpin&#x201D; structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, right upper panel) and that amino acids F409, K425, Y428, D431, A476, R581, and R582 of TRIM47 form a &#x201C;hairpin&#x201D; structure (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, right lower panel). Based on the 3D complex structure model, it was deduced that these hairpin-like structures were accountable for facilitating their interaction.</p>

        <title>ADAM17 deficiency blocks the Notch signaling pathway, consequently impairing HF development.</title>
        <p>To explore intrinsic effects resulting from the loss of ADAM17 expression, we performed proteomic analysis on the dorsal skin during the anagen phase (P28). Analysis of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> variant led to broad changes in protein levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A and B</xref>). Specifically, we detected a significant increase in ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis enzymes (Vkorc1, Coq6, and Coq3), along with the upregulation of the Adam17-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase Trim47 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A and B</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6D</xref>). Then we verified the upregulation of TRIM47 in mouse skin samples and HaCaT cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>, E&#x2013;G). Our study revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> mutation markedly affected the proper development and organization of HFs. Indeed, significant reductions were observed in proteins related to keratinocyte differentiation and HF morphogenesis (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), especially proteins linked to hair shaft and IRS structure (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated decreased activity within structural homeostasis-related pathways, including Notch signaling pathway and cell adhesion pathway (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Previous research has indicated that ADAM17 can shed TGF-&#x3B1;, which in turn actives EGFR signaling in HFs (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Thus, we conducted immunohistochemical staining to examine the influence of <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> variant on the EGFR signaling pathway. Our findings revealed that the <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> variant did not impact the expression of EGFR, as well as the phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 992 (p-EGFR [Tyr992]) and tyrosine 1068 (p-EGFR [Tyr1068]) in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). Given that Notch signaling exerts regulatory effects on the differentiation of HFSCs into specific HF cell types, is it plausible that Notch is the underlying cause of the hair loss phenotype observed in ADAM17-mutant mice? The activity of key molecules in the Notch signaling pathway was investigated in humans and mouse samples. Ligand-mediated activation induces proteolytic cleavages of Notch and releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus and stimulates transcription of target genes (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the protein level of NICD upon <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> variant, leading to decreased expression of Notch target genes, including <italic toggle="yes">Hes1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hes5</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Hey1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Hey2</italic> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, A and B</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>, A and B). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that the <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> mutation resulted in inhibited Notch target gene transcripts in mouse skin (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays revealed a reduced amount of NICD in the HFs of mice during anagen (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, D and E</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8C</xref>). The nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction assays further verified that the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) variants effectively inhibited the Notch signaling pathway in keratinocytes. This is supported by the observed reduction in the expression of NICD and its target genes within the cell nucleus (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). To further investigate the involvement of the Notch signaling pathway in <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> mutation&#x2013;induced HF malformation, we overexpressed NICD in primary cultured Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mouse skin fibroblasts. Our findings indicated that <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> mutation significantly reduced the proliferation ability of primary fibroblasts, which could be rescued by overexpression of NICD (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, G and H</xref>, and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>, D and E). Collectively, our results validate the relationship between the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation and Notch activation in HF development (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study presented compelling evidence for the involvement of ADAM17 in the growth of HFs and differentiation of HFSCs, underscoring its significance as a potent molecule in the development of HYPT. Our investigation revealed that <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> (p.D647N) variant caused HYPT in humans, and a <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> (p.D647N) mutation mouse model successfully emulated sparse and woolly hair observed in HYPT. Moreover, detailed mechanistic investigations demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> mutation enhanced the interaction between ADAM17 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM47, leading to increased auto-ubiquitination and consequent degradation of ADAM17. Then, reduced ADAM17 expression led to a decrease in the Notch signaling pathway, ultimately inhibiting the development of HFs.</p>
      <p>Inherited hair loss disorders exhibit clinical and genetic heterogeneity, making it challenging to genotype patients accurately for diagnosis confirmation and genetic counseling. To date, over 14 detailed pathogenic genes of HYPT are reported to link with nonsyndromic hypotrichosis, including hereditary hypotrichosis simplex (HHS), Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis, localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH), ADWH, and ARWH (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). HYPT3 and HYPT13 with pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">KRT74</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">KRT71</italic> genes, respectively, were also classified as ADWH subtypes 1 and 2 (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this study, we identified a subtype of congenital hypotrichosis with woolly hair that we designated ADWH3, caused by a heterozygous mutation in <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic>. Affected women exhibited curly hair resembling steel wool, while men displayed a range of phenotypic severity from limited to complete baldness, notwithstanding the pervasive thinning of body hair. Unlike HHS and LAH, which only affects scalp hair or is limited to some areas (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), ADWH3&#x2019;s phenotypes were distinguished by a general scarcity of hair throughout the body. Nonetheless, typical of other forms of HYPT, progressive hair loss with age was also extensive (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Given the challenges associated with distinguishing this type of disorder from other congenital HYPT, genetic testing assumes critical importance.</p>
      <p>Although the dominant variant in the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> gene causes hypotrichosis with woolly hair in humans, homozygous variants are necessary to observe the phenotype in mice. Notably, the homozygous mice, exhibiting a more severe phenotype than heterozygous patients, were characterized by developmental retardation, edema in their extremities, and a markedly high mortality rate during the peri-weaning period. This phenotypic difference is likely due to genetic and biological disparities between mice and humans (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It is important to note the phenotypes observed in animal models may vary from those observed in humans (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). For instance, HPRT deficiency does not constitute a pathological variant in mice, despite its association with severe Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in human hemizygotes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In our study, we found that the heterozygous variant in the <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> gene impaired stability and exhibited haploinsufficiency in humans, while heterozygous variants maintained adequate protein levels, potentially averting hair development abnormalities in mice. However, further experimental investigation is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanism.</p>
      <p>ADAM17, a type I transmembrane protein, is composed of multiple domains. Mutations within these domains can lead to a range of disorders, indicating the sensitivity and delicacy of its structure and function. For instance, mutations in the PD domain have been identified as a key driver of colorectal cancer (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and late-onset Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Compound heterozygous mutations in the MPD and homozygous deletions in disintegrin domain result in neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease 1 (OMIM#614328) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Notably, to date, there are no reported mutations in the highly conserved CANDIS domain. Here, we identified a heterozygous variant in the CANDIS domain of ADAM17 that caused nonsyndromic ADWH3. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that the variant in CANDIS enhanced ADAM17 susceptibility to ubiquitin-mediated degradation by enhancing its association with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47. Ubiquitination is a critical posttranslational modification that plays a pivotal role in protein degradation via the proteasome (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Additionally, various posttranslational modifications play a crucial role in the rapid and reversible activation of ADAM17 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). For instance, cytoplasmic phosphorylation of ADAM17 can regulate its activation, as well as rapid transport to the cell surface (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), which provides a mechanism for fine-tuning ADAM17 activity in response to cellular signals. Our studies enriched the understanding of the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern ADAM17 function and highlight the importance of structural conservation within the CANDIS domain.</p>
      <p>Notch pathway is a highly conserved pathway, which exerts regulatory effects on the differentiation of HFSCs into specific HF cell types and represses their differentiation toward the epidermal cell fate (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Notch signaling also regulates the skin microbiome and inflammation of the HFSC niche, protecting the HF from inflammatory damage (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Notch1-deficient mice exhibited a thinner, shorter, and wavy appearance, accompanied by a defect in the hair cuticle (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), which were also observed in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice. In addition, we identified a marked decrease in the expression of key molecules associated with the Notch signaling pathway in both patients and Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice. These findings establish a correlation between ADAM17 and Notch signaling, which has been previously reported in various diseases, including prostate tumors, non&#x2013;small cell lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetic nephropathy (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, the classical viewpoint suggests ADAM10 directly cleaves the S2 site of Notch1, thereby releasing the NICD. Subsequently, the NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with the DNA-binding protein RBPJ and the coactivator Mastermind to facilitate the transcription of target genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">Hes1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Hey1</italic> (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Conversely, ADAM17 can only activate Notch signaling under nonphysiological conditions in vitro (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). ADAM10/Notch signaling axis&#x2013;mediated regulation of host-microbe symbiosis crucially protects HFs from inflammatory destruction. Disruption of this signaling axis leads to skin dysbiosis and HF destruction mediated by innate lymphoid cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). However, a recent study illustrated that <italic toggle="yes">FGFR2</italic> variants resulted in the activation of EGFR and Notch signaling pathways, along with ADAM10, in an ADAM17-dependent manner (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between ADAM17- and ADAM10-mediated Notch signaling were unknown, it is possible that aberrant activation of ADAM17/EGFR pathways reduces ADAM10 proteolytic activity or alternatively decreases its substrate accessibility (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Moreover, ADAM17/EGFR signaling promotes the development of the IRS, which is crucial for hair shaft formation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, our findings demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Adam17</italic> variant did not impact the expression or phosphorylation of EGFR in Adam17<sup>D647N/D647N</sup> mice. Based on these findings, we speculate that the downregulation of Notch signaling observed in our study appears to be a secondary effect resulting from dysfunction in the downstream signaling of ADAM17. Future studies are necessary to investigate whether other signaling pathways also contribute to <italic toggle="yes">ADAM17</italic> variant&#x2013;mediated hair malformations. Understanding the complex interactions between different signaling pathways and their role in HF development may offer insights into potential therapeutic targets for hair loss and other related disorders.</p>
      <p>Collectively, this study offers valuable insights into the posttranslational modification of ADAM17, highlighting its pivotal function in HF development and expanding the range of inherited hypotrichosis disorders. Our discoveries reveal new possibilities for therapeutic targets for hair loss.</p>
