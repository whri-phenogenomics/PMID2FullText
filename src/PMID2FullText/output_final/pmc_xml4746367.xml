      <abstract>
        <p>Paget disease of bone (PDB) is a skeletal disorder characterized by focal abnormalities of bone remodeling, which result in enlarged and deformed bones in one or more regions of the skeleton. In some cases, the pagetic tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation, resulting in osteosarcoma and, less frequently, in giant cell tumor of bone (GCT). We performed whole-exome sequencing in a large family with 14 PDB-affected members, four of whom developed GCT at multiple pagetic skeletal sites, and we identified the c.2810C&gt;G (p.Pro937Arg) missense mutation in the zinc finger protein 687 gene (<italic>ZNF687</italic>). The mutation precisely co-segregated with the clinical phenotype in all affected family members. The sequencing of seven unrelated individuals with GCT associated with PDB (GCT/PDB) identified the same mutation in all individuals, unravelling a founder effect. <italic>ZNF687</italic> is highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis and is dramatically upregulated in the tumor tissue of individuals with GCT/PDB. Interestingly, our preliminary findings showed that <italic>ZNF687,</italic> indicated as a target gene of the NFkB transcription factor by ChIP-seq analysis, is also upregulated in the peripheral blood of PDB-affected individuals with (n = 5) or without (n = 6) mutations in <italic>SQSTM1</italic>, encouraging additional studies to investigate its potential role as a biomarker of PDB risk.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Paget disease of bone (PDB [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="602080" id="intref0010">602080</ext-link>]) is a common metabolic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased osteoclastic bone resorption coupled with a disorganized increase in osteoblastic bone formation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These abnormalities disrupt normal bone architecture and result in enlarged and deformed bones in one (monostotic form) or more (polyostotic form) regions of the skeleton. In less than 1% of cases, pagetic tissue might undergo neoplastic transformation, resulting in osteosarcoma and, less frequently, in giant cell tumor of bone (GCT); only 117 cases of GCT associated with PDB (GCT/PDB) are reported in the literature.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> These tumors arise in bones affected by PDB, and can appear as multifocal lesions. Despite the fact that familial clustering has been described in PDB-affected individuals with GCT, the underlying genetic alterations and the molecular basis of tumorigenesis in pagetic tissue remain to be defined.</p>
      <p>Genetic factors are important in the pathogenesis of PDB, and in many affected families, inheritance has been described as autosomal dominant. Since 2002, mutations in <italic>SQSTM1</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="601530" id="intref0015">601530</ext-link>) have been identified in up to 40% and 10% of individuals with familial and sporadic PDB, respectively.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Genome-wide association studies have suggested additional predisposition loci in individuals with PDB who are negative for <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Recently, we reported on a large family with 14 members affected by PDB, four of whom developed GCT at single or multiple pagetic skeletal sites.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We excluded the presence of mutations in <italic>SQSTM1</italic> or in other genes known to be associated with PDB-related syndromes (<italic>TNFRSF11A</italic> [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="603499" id="intref0020">603499</ext-link>], <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="602643" id="intref0025">602643</ext-link>], <italic>VCP</italic> [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="601023" id="intref0030">601023</ext-link>], and identified multiple chromosomal regions, potentially housing the causative mutation.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> We now report the identification of a heterozygous missense mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic> (MIM: 6010568) in all affected members of the family and in seven additional unrelated individuals with GCT/PDB. The same mutation (c.2810C&gt;G) and one additional mutation (c.725G&gt;T) in <italic>ZNF687</italic> (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi-n:NM_020832.2" id="intref0035">NM_020832.2</ext-link>) were also detected in two families and in some severe PDB cases (with earlier onset and an increased number of affected skeletal sites) from two cohorts of pagetic individuals with different genetic backgrounds and previously analyzed for <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>

        <p>The pedigrees of familial PDB-affected individuals with GCT and the clinical features of the affected family members are provided in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>A, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>. A replication cohort of seven unrelated PDB individuals with a history of GCT degeneration was also included in the study (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, 30 additional families affected by PDB, 20 of which were negative for mutation screening of <italic>SQSTM1</italic> or other genes associated with PDB-related syndromes, were also tested for <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations. Then, we extended the screening of <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations to two separate cohorts of PDB-affected individuals of Italian (n = 628) and multiethnic American (n = 342) backgrounds; these cohorts were previously analyzed for <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations. Unaffected control individuals of Italian (n = 564) and North-American (n = 269) origins were also screened as a reference. Clinical characteristics of PDB-affected individuals and control individuals are shown in the Supplemental Data (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). The studies were approved by ethics review committees at the relevant institutions and all participants provided informed consent.</p>

        <title>Whole-Exome Sequencing Strategy</title>
        <p>Genomic DNA samples from four family members belonging to the extended pedigree were tested with the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ ExomeTM capture kits (Roche), and the resultant fragments were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx (Illumina) with 90&#xA0;bp paired-end reads. Reads were obtained and aligned to the human reference genomic sequence (UCSC Genome Browser GRCh37/hg19) with MAQ7 and NextGENe software v.2.0. We adopted a prioritization scheme, described in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>, to identify the pathogenic mutation in each individual, similar to the approach used in our recent study.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> First, in order to reduce the number of candidate variants, we excluded the variants registered in the dbSNP131 and in our four in-house exomes, derived from four individuals with unrelated diseases and whose genetic basis was identified in our previous studies.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> After filtering, we compared data from three affected individuals (V-4, V-18, and V-11) to obtain shared variants, and we excluded those present in the healthy subject (V-7), thus identifying 57 variations in 45 genes (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Sanger sequencing allowed us to validate 21 out of these 57 variations.</p>

        <title>Mutation Analysis of <italic>ZNF687</italic></title>
        <p>We conducted mutation screening of all 9 exons of <italic>ZNF687</italic> and their intron-exon boundaries by using PCR followed by automated DNA sequencing. PCR reactions (25&#xA0;&#x3BC;L) were performed with Taq DNA polymerase (1&#xA0;U; Fermentas), 1&#xD7; buffer, deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP, 0.2&#xA0;mM; Amersham), primers (0.5&#xA0;&#x3BC;M), and DNA (100&#xA0;ng). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94&#xB0;C for 3&#xA0;min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#xB0;C for 30 s, 30&#xA0;s at annealing temperature, extension at 72&#xB0;C for 45 s, and a final extension for 10&#xA0;min at 72&#xB0;C.</p>
        <p>Samples were ExoSap-digested (Amersham) and sequenced with the Big Dye Terminator Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were performed with a 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) for 25 cycles of 95&#xB0;C for 10 s, 50&#xB0;C for 5 s, and 60&#xB0;C for 2&#xA0;min. After sequencing, each reaction was column purified (Amersham) to remove excess dye terminators.</p>
        <p>The sequencing of the products was performed with the ABI Prism 3710 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).</p>

        <title>Generation of Human Osteoclasts from PBMCs</title>
        <p>Osteoclasts were generated in&#xA0;vitro, with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers and age- and sex-matched pagetic individuals. PBMCs were isolated from citrate blood samples by density-gradient centrifugation in Ficoll (Histopaque 1077 Human Lymphocyte, Sigma-Aldrich), washed in 1&#xD7; PBS, and re-suspended in alpha-minimal essential medium (&#x3B1;-MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Life Science), containing 100&#xA0;U/mL penicillin, 100&#xA0;mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), 2&#xA0;mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). PBMCs were cultured in 96-well plates (8&#xA0;&#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well) for RNA extraction, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, and immunofluorescence.

Considering the high number of meiotic events in this extended pedigree, which reduces the number of candidate variants, we performed whole-exome sequencing of three affected PDB individuals (V-4, V-18, and V-11), two of whom had recurrent GCT, and one healthy subject (V-7) from family 1. We adopted a prioritization scheme, described in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>, to identify the pathogenic mutation in each individual, similar to the approach used in our recent study.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> After excluding common SNPs and variants registered in the dbSNP131 and in our four in-house exomes (which are derived from four individuals with other diseases not related to bone metabolism, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="603278" id="intref0040">603278</ext-link>] and congenital fiber type disproportion [MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="255310" id="intref0045">255310</ext-link>]), we identified 21 candidate variants (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S3</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Only one showed precise co-segregation with the disease phenotype in the family: the c.2810C&gt;G heterozygous change in exon six of <italic>ZNF687</italic>, which causes the p.Pro937Arg amino acid change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>B). <italic>ZNF687</italic> is localized on chromosome 1 (1q21.3), in one of the linkage candidate regions described in our previous report (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S1</xref>).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>

The c.2810C&gt;G mutation was not identified in a cohort of 564 unrelated healthy control individuals from the same geographical origin. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the same c.2810C&gt;G mutation (founder mutation) in all affected members of family 1, but not in unaffected members. Moreover, the same mutation was detected in seven additional unrelated individuals with PDB complicated with GCT (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S4</xref>). Four of these individuals were from the same circumscribed area of Southern Italy as family 1, and three were North-American individuals of European descent.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In order to verify the hypothesis of a common ancestral chromosome among these GCT/PDB cases, we analyzed the segregation of rare variants in genes surrounding the <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutation, identifying, in all but one, identical variants for <italic>SV2A</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="185860" id="intref0050">185860</ext-link>), <italic>SETDB1</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="604396" id="intref0055">604396</ext-link>), <italic>ZNF687</italic>, and <italic>HRNR</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="616293" id="intref0060">616293</ext-link>).

        <title>Identification of <italic>ZNF687</italic> Mutations in Individuals with Severe PDB</title>
        <p>To determine the role of <italic>ZNF687</italic> in PDB-affected individuals without neoplastic transformation, we first analyzed the entire coding region of the gene in 30 additional PDB probands, 20 of whom were negative for <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations, as well as for mutations in other genes associated with PDB-related syndromes. Each of the analyzed probands had at least another family member with PDB, showing vertical transmission, which is consistent with the autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern of the disease. Mutation analysis identified the c.2810C&gt;G mutation in one proband (II-1, family 2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;1</xref>A) and a new mutation, c.725G&gt;T (p.Ser242Ile), in exon 2 of <italic>ZNF687</italic> in a different proband (family 3) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;2</xref>A). The c.2810C&gt;G mutation segregated with the disease phenotype in family 2; it was detected in the affected relative (II-3) but not in his healthy brother (II-2). The proband (II-6) and all affected siblings (II-1 and II-3) of family 3 were heterozygous for the <italic>ZNF687</italic> c.725G&gt;T missense mutation. This mutation was not detected in the three unaffected family members (II-2, II-4, and II-5) of family 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B) and was not reported in the 1000 Genome and ExAC databases. The serine at the 242 position of ZNF687 is highly conserved in all species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;2</xref>C), and the p.Ser242Ile change was predicted in&#xA0;silico (by SIFT, PolyPhen, PMut, and Align GVGD) to be highly pathogenic, suggesting a causative role. Computational analysis strongly suggested Ser242 to be an important phosphorylation site (score of 0.996 in NetPhos prediction).<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Subsequently, both the c.2810C&gt;G and c.725G&gt;T mutations were screened by TaqMan assay in two cohorts of PDB-affected individuals of different ethnicity.

Both mutations were absent in chromosome samples from the two cohorts of control individuals of Italian and North-American origin. All these data suggest that <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations are present in a subset of individuals with familial PDB and more rarely in individuals with sporadic PDB. Moreover, most individuals with <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations showed a severe form of PDB, with an earlier onset and greater number of affected skeletal sites than individuals with or without <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;2</xref>D).</p>

        <title>Role of ZNF687 in Bone Metabolism</title>
        <p>The expression profile of <italic>ZNF687</italic> was evidenced by real-time PCR in all examined adult human tissues, including bone (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S3</xref>). To investigate <italic>ZNF687</italic> mRNA expression during osteoclast formation, PBMCs from healthy volunteers were induced to osteoclastogenesis by treatment with M-CSF and sRANKL. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed by TRAP staining as described in <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">Subjects and Methods</xref>. Our results showed that, after treatment with M-CSF and RANKL, <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression was significantly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>A). Furthermore, given that GCT derives from the uncontrolled proliferation of mesenchymal stromal cells committed toward osteoblastic lineage, we also evaluated <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression during osteoblastogenesis. As expected, <italic>ZNF687</italic> mRNA expression was higher in differentiated osteoblasts than in their undifferentiated precursors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>B). Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>ZNF687</italic> plays a role in bone metabolism and that it is highly expressed during osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation. To further verify this, we evaluated the expression levels of the two zebrafish orthologs (<italic>ZNF687a</italic> and <italic>ZNF687b</italic>) during <italic>Danio rerio</italic> development and during tissue regeneration (blastema), after caudal fin amputation. Both genes showed high expression levels during the regeneration of the caudal fin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D), suggesting a possible role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with this observation, both genes appeared to be maternally inherited and highly expressed in the initial stages of zebrafish development. Interestingly, expression of <italic>ZNF687a</italic> increased again between 24&#xA0;hr and 5 dpf and after 20 dpf, when hematopoiesis and osteoclastogenesis are known to occur in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>E).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Accordingly, <italic>ZNF687a</italic> was also highly expressed in adult kidney and spleen tissues, the major organs for proliferation and differentiation of the hematopoietic cells, including osteoclast precursors (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S4</xref>).</p>

        <title>Functional Consequences of <italic>ZNF687</italic> Mutation</title>
        <p>Bioinformatic analysis suggested that ZNF687 contains a strong nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence between amino acids 938 and 954 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;3</xref>F). The substitution of the arginine at the 937 position generates a stronger NLS that could enhance ZNF687 nuclear import. Therefore, we performed cellular protein fractionation analysis followed by Western blotting by using anti-ZNF687 antibody. Our analysis revealed ZNF687 to be less prominent in the cytoplasmic fraction in lymphoblastic cell lines derived from PDB-affected individuals with c.2810C&gt;G mutation than in those derived from control individuals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>G and 3H). We also found a parallel increase of ZNF687 in the nuclear fraction, suggesting that c.2810C&gt;G acts as gain-of-function mutation, altering the nuclear-cytoplasmic balance of ZNF687, thus leading to enhanced availability of this transcription factor in the nucleus. To directly test the causal link between the c.2810C&gt;G mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic> and the osteoclast differentiation process, human PBMCs, derived from five PDB-affected individuals carrying the c.2810C&gt;G mutation, were differentiated into osteoclasts in the presence of sRANKL and M-CSF cytokines. Interestingly, osteoclasts cultured from these individuals showed a greater number of nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I&#x2013;3J) as well as a larger surface area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>I and 3K) than did those from the control individuals, both features being peculiar for pagetic osteoclasts.</p>

        <title>Increased <italic>ZNF687</italic> Expression in PDB-Affected Individuals</title>
        <p>Given that PDB is a disease of the osteoclast and <italic>ZNF687</italic> is&#xA0;upregulated during osteoclastogenesis, we evaluated <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression in PDB-affected individuals with different genetic backgrounds. Using real-time PCR, we assessed the expression level of <italic>ZNF687</italic> in PBMCs from six PDB-affected individuals without a <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutation, five PDB-affected individuals with a <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutation, five PDB-affected individuals with a <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutation, and three healthy subjects. Of interest, <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression levels were significantly higher in PDB-affected individuals with (3-fold) or without (2-fold) an <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutation than in the control individuals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S5</xref>). Moreover, a larger increase (5-fold) was observed in PDB-affected individuals exhibiting the c.2810C&gt;G mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#xA0;S5</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>ZNF687</italic> is involved in PDB pathogenesis regardless of the genetic background of PDB-affected individuals. Its expression profile remarkably correlates with the clinical severity of the disease. To further clarify <italic>ZNF687</italic> involvement in PDB pathogenesis, we first analyzed the ChIPBase database, an integrated platform for decoding transcription factor binding sites (including 11 independent ChIP-seq experiments of NFkB transcription factor).<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Interestingly, in all experiments, <italic>ZNF687</italic> was detected as a genomic target of NFkB in its putative promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>B). Similar to <italic>ZNF687</italic>, <italic>ZMYND8</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="615713" id="intref0065">615713</ext-link>) and <italic>ZNF592</italic> (MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="613624" id="intref0070">613624</ext-link>), the other two partners of ZNF687 in the Z3 complex formation, are regulated by NFkB transcription factor, which binds their promoters (data not shown). Next, we evaluated <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression in tumor tissues derived from five individuals with GCT/PDB. As expected, in comparison to expression in healthy bone marrow, a dramatic increase in <italic>ZNF687</italic> expression was observed in the RNAs extracted from tumor biopsies of these individuals, confirming the pathological role of <italic>ZNF687</italic>, whose expression resulted from the c.2810C&gt;G mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>C). These data were reinforced by immunohistochemistry assays performed on tumor sections of the same GCT/PDB-affected individuals, in which we observed stronger ZNF687 staining in the pathological giant cells than in the stromal cells, in comparison to the negative section (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>D and 4E).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Neoplastic transformation is a rare but serious complication of PDB, occurring in less than 1% of PDB-affected individuals. In a recent analysis of the cumulative survival curves of GCT occurring in individuals with or without PDB, we demonstrated that about half of PDB-affected individuals die within five years of the diagnosis of GCT, increasing to 80% after ten years.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Here, we identify a pathogenic missense mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic> (c.2810C&gt;G) in a large pagetic family characterized by an enhanced prevalence of GCT in up to 30% of affected members. The same mutation was also identified in all the tested unrelated individuals with PDB and GCT, as well as in one individual with PDB and a positive family history of&#xA0;GCT. Moreover, replication analysis identified the <italic>ZNF687</italic> c.2810C&gt;G mutation and a new <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutation (c.725G&gt;T) in two families with a clear family history for PDB. A further analysis of two large cohorts of unrelated PDB-affected individuals with different ethnic backgrounds identified the <italic>ZNF687</italic> c.2810C&gt;G mutation in 0.3% and 0.6% of cases, respectively. All individuals harboring mutations, except one, had polyostotic disorder with a significantly increased number of affected skeletal sites and an earlier onset of disease than PDB-affected individuals without the mutation, including PDB-affected individuals with the <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutation. Taken together, these results indicate that mutations in <italic>ZNF687</italic> are associated with severe PDB, with a prevalence of 3/31 (10%) in our familial cases with a documented autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, whereas they occur rarely in non-familial disease. Given that all the individuals with PDB and GCT tested in this study were positive for the mutation, we conclude that this <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutation is responsible for severe PDB, sometimes complicated by GCT, in the presence of an impaired response to antiresorptive treatment.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
      <p><italic>ZNF687</italic> encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein expressed in most tissues, including bone, that, together with ZMYND8 and ZNF592, is part of the transcriptional regulator complex Z3.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Despite different C2H2 zinc finger proteins being identified as important regulators of skeletal development and maintenance, the role of <italic>ZNF687</italic> in bone metabolism has never been identified.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Our in&#xA0;vitro and in&#xA0;vivo findings indicate that ZNF687 has bone regulatory properties. First, it is upregulated during osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and is highly expressed during the regeneration of caudal fins in zebrafish, suggesting a role of this transcriptional co-regulator in bone cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, <italic>ZNF687</italic> has been shown to be overexpressed in all the tested PBMC samples derived from PDB-affected individuals, irrespective of the genetic defect, given that this gene is a downstream target of NFkB, allowing us to hypothesize the mechanism reported in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#xA0;4</xref>F.</p>
      <p>The exact mechanism by which <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations cause PDB and eventually GCT remains unknown. Because a stronger NLS was observed in the presence of the proline to arginine substitution at the 937 position, we hypothesize that the mutation acts as a gain of function, leading to the constitutive accumulation of ZNF687 in the nucleus, thus increasing the transcription of its downstream targets, which in turn might promote the development of the disorder. Remarkably, osteoclasts derived from PBMCs of PDB-affected individuals with the c.2810C&gt;G mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic> were increased in size and contained more nuclei than normal osteoclasts, which are both features of osteoclasts isolated from pagetic tissue.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These data suggest that the c.2810C&gt;G mutation might contribute to PDB susceptibility by affecting osteoclast phenotype.</p>
      <p>In addition, considering that we identified the c.725G&gt;T mutation in familial individuals only affected by PDB, we hypothesized that c.725G&gt;T mutation is responsible for the onset of PDB, but not associated with GCT development. Therefore, we speculated that, differently from the c.2810C&gt;G mutation, the biological defect of c.725G&gt;T does not result in the neoplastic transformation of PDB tissue. Further functional studies are required to address this point as well as the biological difference with the c.2810C&gt;G mutation.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, in this study we identified mutations in <italic>ZNF687</italic> as a monogenic cause of a severe, early-onset form of PDB, which is associated in some instances (c.2810C&gt;G mutation) with an increased likelihood of GCT. This evidence, together with our in&#xA0;vitro and in&#xA0;vivo experimental observations, emphasizes a previously unexpected role of <italic>ZNF687</italic> in bone metabolism. It would be of interest to determine the <italic>ZNF687</italic> role in other neoplastic conditions related to PDB, such as osteosarcoma, that, like GCT, are due to the malignant transformation of mesenchymal stromal cells.</p>
      <p>Finally, a better characterization of the downstream pathways regulated by this transcriptional co-regulator in bone cells might be relevant for the identification of new therapeutic targets for PDB and other disorders of skeletal metabolism.</p>

        <p>Identification of the c.2810C&gt;G Mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic></p>
        <p>(A) The pedigree of family 1, including 14 affected members, four of whom developed GCT at pagetic skeletal sites. Circles indicate female family members, and squares indicate male family members; slashes indicate that the family member is deceased. Family members with the GCT/PDB phenotype are indicated by a white dot in solid symbols, those with PDB are indicated by solid symbols, and those without any clinical symptoms are indicated by open symbols. + or &#x2013; signs indicate the presence or absence of the c.2810C&gt;G mutation. This panel also includes the pedigree for a different family (family 2) with the same c.2810C&gt;G mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic>. The index individual with PDB (II-1) is indicated by an arrow.</p>
        <p>(B) The DNA sequence of a segment flanking c.2810C&gt;G in <italic>ZNF687</italic> from an unaffected family member (left) and a heterozygous GCT/PDB-affected individual (right). A single base substitution changes the non-mutant cytosine to guanine, leading to the substitution of proline (P) for arginine (R) at the 937 codon (indicated by a solid line).</p>
        <p>(C) A portion of the amino acid sequence of ZNF687 from diverse mammal species.</p>
        <p>(D) The ancestral haplotype with rare variants in <italic>SV2A-rs149735232</italic> (t minor-allele frequency = 1.5%), <italic>SETDB1-rs138864506</italic> (t minor-allele frequency = 0.1%), <italic>ZNF687-rs142842127</italic> (a minor-allele frequency = 0.2%), and <italic>HRNR</italic> (ta deletion, frequency not available), all of which are genes surrounding the c.2810C&gt;G mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic>. For each variant, the position on chromosome 1 is indicated by arabic numerals.</p>

        <p>Identification of the c.725G&gt;T Mutation in <italic>ZNF687</italic></p>
        <p>(A) The pedigree of family 3. The index individual is indicated by an arrow. Individuals with PDB are indicated by black symbols, and individuals without PDB are shown as unfilled symbols. Circles represent females, squares represent males, and slashes indicate deceased subjects.</p>
        <p>(B) The DNA sequence of a segment flanking c.725G&gt;T in <italic>ZNF687</italic> from an unaffected family member (left) and a heterozygous PDB-affected individual (right). A single base substitution changes the non-mutant guanine to thymine, leading to the substitution of serine (S) for isoleucine (I) at the 242 codon (indicated by a solid line).</p>
        <p>(C) The evolutive conservation of the 242 serine from rodents to humans.</p>
        <p>(D) The number of the affected skeletal sites (left) and the age of disease onset (right) across PDB-affected individuals with <italic>ZNF687</italic> mutations, PDB-affected individuals with <italic>SQSTM1</italic> mutations, and PDB-affected individuals without mutations in either gene. Genotype-phenotype correlations were tested by ANOVA with Bonferroni correction and reported as mean ratio &#xB1; SEM (not mutated, n = 615; mutated in <italic>SQSTM1</italic>, n = 78; mutated in <italic>ZNF687</italic>, n = 20). <sup>&#x2217;</sup>p &lt; 0.05; <sup>&#x2217;&#x2217;</sup>p &lt; 0.01; <sup>&#x2217;&#x2217;&#x2217;</sup>p &lt; 0.001.</p>
