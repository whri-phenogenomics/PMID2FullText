Susceptibility to cellular stress in theGdap2 model suggests altered stress responses as a pathological mechanism.AbstractAutosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are a group of rare disorders that share progressive degeneration of the cerebellum and associated tracts as the main hallmark. Here, we report two unrelated patients with a new subtype of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by biallelic, gene-disruptive mutations inGDAP2, a gene previously not implicated in disease. Both patients had onset of ataxia in the fourth decade. Other features included progressive spasticity and dementia. Neuropathological examination showed degenerative changes in the cerebellum, olive inferior, thalamus, substantia nigra, and pyramidal tracts, as well as tau pathology in the hippocampus and amygdala. To provide further evidence for a causative role ofGDAP2 mutations in autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia pathophysiology, its orthologous gene was investigated in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster. Ubiquitous knockdown ofDrosophila Gdap2 resulted in shortened lifespan and motor behaviour anomalies such as righting defects, reduced and uncoordinated walking behaviour, and compromised flight. Gdap2 expression levels responded to stress treatments in control flies, and Gdap2 knockdown flies showed increased sensitivity to deleterious effects of stressors such as reactive oxygen species and nutrient deprivation. Thus,Gdap2 knockdown inDrosophila andGDAP2 loss-of-function mutations in humans lead to locomotor phenotypes, which may be mediated by altered responses to cellular stress.autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxiaspasticitywhole exome sequencingDrosophila melanogastercellular stressE-RARE-3 Joint Transnational CallZonMW10.13039/5011000018269003037604Radboud university medical centre junior researcherE-Rare Network NEUROLIPID01GM1408BUS National Institutes of Health5R01NS072248U54NS092091Association Belge contre les Maladies Neuromusculaires10.13039/100007372EU FP7/2007-20132012-305121Senior Clinical Researcher mandate of the Research Fund - FlandersHersenstichting10.13039/501100008358Bioblast PharmaNIH10.13039/100000002) -->

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCAs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of mainly degenerative diseases of the cerebellum and, often, of other central and peripheral nervous system components (<xref rid="awy198-B2" ref-type="bibr">Anheim<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Mutations in &gt;100 different genes are associated with ataxia. While most of these genes are included in current diagnostic gene panels, not all ARCA patients can be genetically characterized, suggesting the existence of even more ARCA genes. Presumably, some of these yet unidentified ARCA subtypes are extremely rare or private, complicating their discovery. There is growing evidence for a convergence of molecular processes implicated in ataxias (<xref rid="awy198-B32" ref-type="bibr">Lim<italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B49" ref-type="bibr">Smeets and Verbeek, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B14" ref-type="bibr">Didonna and Opal, 2016</xref>). Further insight into these processes remains a crucial requisite when striving for targeted interventions in these currently untreatable disorders.</p>
      <p>Here, we report mutations in<italic>GDAP2</italic> in patients with a new ARCA subtype and describe the corresponding neuropathology. A<italic>Drosophila</italic> GDAP2 model supports a role of GDAP2 in motor behaviour and suggests that cellular stress might be driving the neurodegenerative cascade.</p>

      <title>Materials and methods</title>
      <p>The Nijmegen (NIJ) and Antwerp (AW) sites, connected via existing European research networks on ataxia [Ataxia Study Group (ASG,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ataxia-study-group.net">www.ataxia-study-group.net</ext-link>) and E-rare consortium PREPARE], both initiated exome sequencing for diagnostic and research purposes in patients with (presumed) inherited ataxia. Independently, variants in<italic>GDAP2</italic> were identified in two unrelated ARCA patients.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Genetic testing</title>
        <p>Both patients gave consent for further genetic testing. Exome sequencing was essentially performed as previously described (<xref rid="awy198-B50" ref-type="bibr">Synofzik<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B51" ref-type="bibr">van de Warrenburg<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Briefly, capture of exons was done using a SureSelect XT Human All Exon 50Mb Kit V5 (Agilent). Sequencing was performed using a Hiseq 2000 (Illumina). Read mapping and variant calling were done using BWA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/index/shtml">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/index/shtml</ext-link>) and GATK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/</ext-link>), respectively.</p>
        <p>For proband Patient NIJ, the median target coverage was at least 75. Annotation was done using an in-house designed pipeline (<xref rid="awy198-B38" ref-type="bibr">Neveling<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Altogether, 117 708 variants (single nucleotide variants and small deletions/insertions/indels) were detected. Initial filtering for a gene panel of movement disorders revealed no mutations. Gene panel DGD200614 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://issuu.com/radboudumc/docs/dgd200614_movement_disorders?e=28355229/50854884">https://issuu.com/radboudumc/docs/dgd200614_movement_disorders?e=28355229/50854884</ext-link>) was used. The full exome sequencing dataset was then filtered for all deletions, insertions, nonsense, and canonical splice site variants, as well as for evolutionary conserved missense variants. The data were filtered for all homozygous and compound heterozygous variants, with a frequency below 1:1000 in dbSNP, the Nijmegen exome database (&gt;10 000 exomes), or ExAC (Exome Aggregation Consortium).</p>
        <p>For proband Patient AW, annotation and filtering was performed using the GENESIS (gem.app) platform, a web-based tool for next generation sequencing data analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://thegenesisprojectfoundation.org/">http://thegenesisprojectfoundation.org/</ext-link>) (<xref rid="awy198-B22" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>,<xref rid="awy198-B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A total of 90.8 million reads were produced for this sample, 99.93% of which could be aligned to the targeted sequence. Mean coverage of the targeted sequence was 75-fold; 90 560 single-nucleotide variations and 8961 indels were called. No obvious variants in known ataxia genes were observed. Variants were filtered for (i) non-synonymous homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in genes that were (ii) absent or extremely rare (minor allele frequency &lt;0.5%) in the public databases dbSNP137, NHLBI ESP6500, 1000Genomes project, and ExAC (60 706 exomes; Exome Aggregation Consortium,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/">http://exac.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>) as well as in GENESIS (&lt;11 heterozygous or homozygous alleles in 6064 subjects in the GENESIS database); (iii) showed a rather high conservation [PhastCons score (100 vertebrate genomes) &gt;0.75, phyloP (100 vertebrate genomes) &gt;2]; and (iv) high genotype quality [quality filter (QUAL) &gt;50 and genotype quality &gt;75].</p>
        <p>In both families, Sanger sequencing was performed for confirmation of the variants and for segregation analyses using standard techniques.</p>

        <title>Neuropathological examination</title>
        <p>Patient AW had given consent for a post-mortem brain examination. The neuropathological examination was conducted on paraffin sections representative of all parts of the brain. Paraffin sections were stained for cytology (Nissl, haematoxylin and eosin), and myelin (Kl&#xFC;ver-Barrera). Immunostaining was performed using the citrate buffer epitope retrieval method. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation for 20 min at room temperature in a PBS/0.1% Triton&#x2122; X-100 (Sigma) solution containing 10% methanol and 0.003% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Microscope slides carrying brain sections were washed three times and incubated in the blocking solution (0.1% PBS, 4% Triton<sup>&#x2122;</sup> X-100, 4% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were then incubated for 48 h at 4&#xB0;C with specific antibodies diluted in blocking solution against the following proteins: hyperphosphorylated protein tau AT8, amyloid-&#x3B2; 17-24 4G8, ubiquitin, TDP-43, p62, alpha-synuclein and 1C2 against expanded polyglutamine chains. Sections were washed three times, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the corresponding biotinylated appropriate (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) secondary antibody (1:250; Vector Laboratories) diluted in blocking solution and washed another three times. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ABC amplification system (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) with 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB Metal Concentrate; Biogenex) as the substrate. The sections, nuclear-counterstained with haematoxylin or not, were dehydrated twice in ethanol and xylene solutions and mounted with Eukitt&#xAE;. The lesions were semi-quantitatively assessed and estimated as severe, moderate or absent.</p>

        <title>Flystocks and breeding</title>
        <p>Fly stocks were maintained at room temperature on standard<italic>Drosophila</italic> diet (cornmeal, sugar and yeast). Crosses were maintained at 25&#xB0;C, 70% humidity, 12 h light-dark cycle. The<italic>Gdap2</italic> RNAi lines vdrc39224 with RNAi construct 15367 (Gdap2 RNAi-1) and vdrc100622 with RNAi construct 108807 (Gdap2 RNAi-2) and their corresponding genetic control lines vdrc60000 (control-1) and vdrc60100 (control-2) were obtained from the Vienna<italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Centre. The genomic insertion site of vdrc100622 was characterized by PCR as previously described and found to be at landing site 30B3, not prone to reported potential dominant phenotypes unrelated to RNAi (<xref rid="awy198-B23" ref-type="bibr">Green<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B52" ref-type="bibr">Vissers<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). RNAi was induced with the Gal4 driver<italic>UAS-Dicer-2;Actin-Gal4/CyO, GFP</italic>. The original stock, #25708, was obtained from the Bloomington<italic>Drosophila</italic> stock centre (Indiana University) and rebalanced with CyO-GFP. For all experiments, knockdown flies were compared to their appropriate genetic background controls [progeny of the promoter line crossed with the genetic background of the vdrc GD (vdrc60000) or KK (vdrc60100) RNAi library].</p>

        <title>Verification of<italic>Gdap2</italic> knockdown efficiency by quantitative PCR</title>
        <p>To evaluate the RNAi-induced<italic>Gdap2</italic> knockdown efficiency, 2-day-old males of the appropriate genotypes were selected for reverse transcriptase quantitative (q)PCR. Total RNA was purified from whole bodies (five animals were used per biological replicate) and qPCR were performed as described with the following adaptations (<xref rid="awy198-B36" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay<italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). RNA was subjected to DNase treatment using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) before cDNA synthesis to avoid genomic contamination. RNA PolII (5&#x2032;-CCGCGATACTTCTCTCCAC-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GACCAGCTAGGCGACATTC-3&#x2032;) was used as the reference gene.<italic>Gdap2</italic> primer sequences were 5&#x2032;-AACTATCCATCGCTGCACTG-3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;-GGGGTGCACGATATAGAAGG-3&#x2032;. For each genotype, three biological and two technical replicates were analysed.</p>

        <title>Eclosion rate and survival</title>
        <p>For Gdap2 knockdown, homozygous Gdap2 RNAi-1 or -2 males were mated to heterozygous<italic>UAS-Dicer-2;Actin-Gal4/CyO, GFP</italic> virgins yielding progenies of two genotypes, the expected ratios of which provided the basis for the evaluation of the eclosion rate. For this, the number of non-<italic>CyO, GFP Gdap2</italic> knockdown males and<italic>Cyo, GFP</italic> siblings from five independent crosses was counted for five consecutive days. The experiment was repeated three times. For survival, at least 60 male flies were collected at the day of eclosion for each genotype and were subsequently aged on standard fly food. Every 2&#x2013;3 days adults were transferred to vials with fresh food and dead flies were counted until all had died.</p>

        <title>Island assay</title>
        <p>The island assay was used to evaluate the locomotor behaviour of the 2-day-old<italic>Drosophila</italic> GDAP2 knockdown models as described (<xref rid="awy198-B45" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kochinke<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B19" ref-type="bibr">Eidhof<italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>

        <title>Locomotion assay</title>
        <p>Aliquots of 10 male flies per genotype were collected the day of eclosion and transferred to a new vial containing standard food. Tracking was carried out the next day under constant conditions (25&#xB0;C, 70% humidity, during Zeitgeber time 1&#x2013;3). In brief, experimental flies were transferred to an arena without anaesthesia and were allowed to acclimatize for 5 min. Tracking arenas were 37 mm in diameter and 4 mm in height, allowing flies to freely walk but not jump or fly. Next, 7-min videos (10 frames per second) were recorded using HandyAvi software (Azcendant) connected to a Logitech C525 webcam positioned directly above the centre of the arena. Locomotion was tracked using the semi-automatic machine-vision program Ctrax (v.0.5.6) (<xref rid="awy198-B9" ref-type="bibr">Branson<italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Distances within the videos were calibrated based on arena diameter. The Ctrax output files were further analysed in Excel, to calculate total distance and average velocity. For each genotype, three biological replicates were analysed.</p>

        <title>Cell-death staining and immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
        <p>To detect cell death, 2-day-old male flies were kept for 18 h on standard food containing 25 mM paraquat. Brains were dissected and fixed for 30 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, rinsed twice in PBS and blocked for 2 h in PBS-Triton<sup>&#x2122;</sup> X-100 (0.3%, PBS-T) containing 5% normal goat serum at room temperature. Brains were incubated with the primary antibodies anti-NC82 (DSHB, 1:125) and anti-Asp175 (Cell Signaling, 1:200) for 2 days at 4&#xB0;C. Brains were washed five times for 10 min in PBS-T and incubated for 2 h with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor<sup>&#xAE;</sup> 568 red mouse (Life Technologies, 1:500) and Alexa Fluor<sup>&#xAE;</sup> 488 green rabbit (Invitrogen, 1:500) at room temperature. Brains were mounted in Vectashield. At least 10 images were taken per genotype with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 fluorescence microscope (63&#xD7; magnification) with Apotome. Asp175-positive cells in a defined region of interest in the protocerebrum were counted in Fiji.</p>

        <title>Stress induction</title>
        <p>Individual, 2-day-old male flies were placed in 65 mm &#xD7; 5 mm glass tubes (Trikinetics) containing either standard food, standard food with 25 mM paraquat to induce oxidative stress, or 5% agar dissolved in water for starvation. Survival data were recorded with the<italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitor (DAM) system (Trikinetics), and binned in 1 h intervals with DAMFileScan software (Trikinetics). Flies were considered dead when no more activity events were recorded. For each genotype, three biological replicates and a minimum of 14 technical replicates were analysed.</p>
        <p>To measure<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels upon stress induction, 2-day-old male flies were selected for RT-qPCR after 0 h, 3 h, 6 h and 12 h stress induction.<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels were normalized against the non-treated condition (0 h). For each genotype, four to six biological and two technical replicates were analysed.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis</title>
        <p>GraphPad Prism software and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey correction for multiple testing was used to calculate significant differences.

          <title>Patient NIJ</title>
          <p>A now 46-year-old Dutch/Egyptian female had started to notice gait difficulties at age 34, soon accompanied by speech changes and difficulty writing. These complaints worsened slowly over time. She started to fall occasionally and had to use a walker at age 43. There were no cognitive problems or autonomic disturbances. Clinical examination at age 44 years showed normal cognition (although there was some suggestion of mental slowing); gaze-evoked nystagmus, jerky pursuit, hypermetric saccades; cerebellar dysarthria; mild leftward torticollis; ataxia on finger chase and heel-shin slide; spastic ataxic gait; lower limb hypertonia; very brisk tendon reflexes, but downgoing plantar responses; no weakness; and normal sensory examination. An MRI brain scan revealed mild cerebellar atrophy. Ophthalmological examinations were normal. Nerve conduction studies and EMG did not show evidence of a peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory testing including vitamin E, metabolic screening, albumin, cholesterol, alpha-fetoprotein, lactate, acanthocytes, copper, ceruloplasmin, and coeliac screen was normal or negative. Genetic testing for Friedreich, spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 14 and 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay and SPG7 were negative.</p>

        <sec sec-type="subjects">
          <title>Patient AW</title>
          <p>This Belgian female had an uneventful prior medical history. Her family history revealed that her brother died from a brain tumour, her father died at age 84 years and had epilepsy, her mother was alive at time of presentation without ataxia or other gait disorder at age 85 years; the patient had a healthy daughter. There was no known consanguinity in the family. First symptoms developed at the age of 38 years with mild gait imbalance that progressively worsened. Speech problems started at the age of 40. Examination at age 52 years, when she was seen first, showed a severe gait ataxia and mild pyramidal features in the form of brisk reflexes; jerky eye movements without clear nystagmus; and disturbances of short-term memory and mild behavioural changes, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 25/30. A clear progression was noted in the following years with further worsening of gait resulting in the use of a walker and later wheelchair (at age 54 years). At that point, clear spasticity in the legs was evident. The patient lost the ability to walk independently by the age of 58 years and by that time cognitive decline had progressed with an MMSE of 15/30, a pronounced dysexecutive syndrome, apathy, periodic aggressive behaviour, and symptoms of depression. Speech became unintelligible around the age of 59 years. Because of progressive dysphagia, a percutaneous gastric tube was placed at the age of 62 years. By that time, the patient was mutistic and bed-ridden. She died due to infectious complications at the age of 62 years. Brain MRI at age 53 years revealed severe atrophy of the cerebellum, both vermian and hemispheric, mainly of the superior aspect, and also global cerebral atrophy (cortical and central). These alterations had clearly progressed on a second MRI 4 years later. Levels of alpha-fetoprotein, vitamin E, copper, and folic acid were normal. Screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions was negative for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 17, and for Friedreich&#x2019;s ataxia.</p>

        <title>Cerebellar and extra-cerebellar pathological changes</title>
        <p>The autopsy of Patient AW was limited to the brain, which weighed 1106 g. Macroscopic examination revealed a cerebellar atrophy in combination with a mild atrophy of the pes pontis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F1">Fig. 1</xref>A and B, arrows). The bulbus olfactorius, the tractus olfactorius and the chiasma opticum were normal. A few small atheromatous plaques were found in the basilar artery. There was a dilatation of the ventricular system on both sides but the white matter had a normal aspect and consistency. The neostriatum, the pallidum and the corpus subthalamicum were normal. On the left side, the pulvinar was small and therefore extra sampling was done at thalamic level. In the brainstem, there was a pallor of the substantia nigra and of the locus coeruleus. On transverse sections, the pes pontis had a normal size with a somewhat smaller tegmentum by comparison. The pyramidal pathways were relatively small in the medulla oblongata. Vertico-frontal slicing of the cerebellum confirmed the atrophy of the cerebellar foliae the more so in the paramedian areas. There was also a minimal atrophy of the dentate nucleus.

        <p>Microscopically, pathological features were found at different levels. First, there was a cerebello-olivar atrophy with a severe and diffuse loss of Purkinje cells, with an increase of the Bergmann cells and also of the glial cells present in the molecular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F1">Fig. 1</xref>C and D). Some remaining Purkinje cells showed a staghorn aspect of the dendritic tree. The involvement of the inner granular layer of the cerebellar foliae was less severe. There was a relative sparing of the flocculo-nodular lobus (archicerebellum). The paleocerebellum was more affected than the neocerebellum. There were neuronal losses and astrocytic gliosis in the parvocellular part of the dentate nucleus. In the medulla oblongata, the inferior olivary nucleus showed neuronal loss more pronounced at the level of the dorsal laminae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F1">Fig. 1</xref>E and F). The griseum pontis was normal and the brachia pontis were normally myelinated. Second, upon examination of the thalamus on both sides and at different levels, there was neuronal loss and astrocytic gliosis in the nucleus anterior, the nucleus dorsalis posterior and in the pulvinar medialis more than the lateralis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F1">Fig. 1</xref>G and H). The lesions did not affect the nuclei according to a strict neuroanatomical pattern. There was also a vacuolation of the neurons in the magnocellular part of the nucleus centralis. Third, we observed neuronal losses in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra with a mild status pigmentatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F1">Fig. 1</xref>I and J), while the locus coeruleus was within normal limits. Fourth, with regard to the motor system, pallor of the pyramidal pathways in the medulla oblongata and loss of neurons in the hypoglossal nucleus was evident.</p>
        <p>With immunohistochemistry, a few neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions immunoreactive for ubiquitin and p62 (both antibodies were used to detect disturbances in ubiquitine proteasome degradation) were found in the neocortex, the hippocampus (including the gyrus dentatus), the hippocampus, the subiculum, the superficial layers of the gyrus parahippocampalis, the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the corpus subthalamicum. They were few in number in the thalamic nuclei except for the magnocellular part of the nucleus centralis. Using a semi-quantitative scale (0, none; 1+, sparse; 2+, moderate; 3+, large amounts of neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions), we obtained 1+ in all locations.

There were neither Lewy bodies nor Lewy neurites with the anti-alpha-synuclein antibody. The 1C2 antibody used to detect trinucleotide repeat expansions, failed to reveal any neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Large amounts of AT8 immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites were exclusively found in the hippocampus and the amygdala corresponding to a stadium III of<xref rid="awy198-B7" ref-type="bibr">Braak and Braak (1991)</xref> while amyloid deposits and senile plaques of all types were wholly absent.</p>

        <title>Exome sequencing identifies variants in<italic>GDAP2</italic></title>
        <p>Exome sequencing for proband Patients NIJ and AW revealed no pathogenic mutation in known genes associated with cerebellar ataxia. Because of the sporadic nature of the cerebellar ataxia in both probands, the most likely inheritance pattern was either<italic>de novo</italic> autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Trio-sequencing analysis to detect putative<italic>de novo</italic> variants was not possible because of the unavailability of paternal DNA for Patient NIJ and parental DNA for Patient AW. Patient NIJ has a Dutch mother and an Egyptian father, suggesting that compound heterozygosity for a novel gene would be a plausible cause of the ataxia in this patient. The most likely candidate gene was<italic>GDAP2</italic>, bearing two putative loss-of-function mutations, a nonsense mutation [NM_017686.3:c.946C&gt;T; p.(Gln316*)] and a frameshift mutation [NM_017686.3:c.1305dup; p.(Ser436fs*36)]. Analysis of the maternal DNA revealed that she carries the p.Gln316* mutation, but not the frameshift mutation, indicating that the mutations in the proband are on opposite alleles.</p>
        <p>Independently, analysis of mutations likely involved in recessive inheritance for Patient AW revealed a damaging homozygous<italic>GDAP2</italic> frameshift mutation [NM_017686.3:c.1198_1199insG; p.(His400fs*15)] as the most likely causal mutation. The variant and its segregation were confirmed in the proband and her daughter using standard Sanger sequencing methodology. There was no known consanguinity in the family, but because of the small size of this kinship this could not be studied further.</p>
        <p>Thus, biallelic mutations in<italic>GDAP2</italic> were identified as most likely disease-causing independently in both patients.</p>
        <p>The three variants found are all likely loss-of-function alleles. The transcripts encoding the nonsense mutation p.(Gln316*) and the frameshift mutation p.(His400fs*15) are likely to undergo nonsense-mediated decay, since they lead to premature termination codons (PTCs) located in the exons 8 and 11 (of the 14 exons of<italic>GDAP2</italic> gene), respectively. The frameshift mutation p.(Ser436fs*36) results in a PTC 36 codons downstream in the penultimate exon. This PTC is only 33 bases from the 3&#x2032; end of the penultimate exon, and may thus escape nonsense-mediated decay. Nevertheless, it is expected to disrupt gene function since it changes the amino acid sequence and length of the C-terminus of the GDAP2 protein by replacing the 62 most C-terminal amino acids by 35 others, damaging the CRAL-TRIO domain, a protein structural domain that binds small lipophilic molecules (<xref rid="awy198-B39" ref-type="bibr">Panagabko<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The large change of the C-terminus may also destabilize the protein and trigger degradation pathways involved in protein quality control.</p>
        <p>Additionally, no homozygous loss-of-function<italic>GDAP2</italic> mutations were identified in controls, while heterozygous loss-of-function variants were present in low allele frequencies only (<xref rid="awy198-B30" ref-type="bibr">Lek<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). One of the mutations described here, p.(Gln316*), was detected with an allele frequency of 0.00008396 only, whereas the other two mutations, p.(Ser436fs*36) and p.(His400fs*15), were not observed.</p>

<italic>Drosophila</italic> Gdap2 knockdown impairs locomotor behaviour</title>
        <p>We next inspected Gdap2 knockdown models for behavioural anomalies. We noticed that Gdap2 knockdown<italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibited righting defects and uncoordinated walking behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). To evaluate the possible effect of Gdap2 knockdown on further aspects of locomotor behaviour, we subjected the Gdap2 knockdown animals to the island assay. In this assay, flies are thrown onto an elevated platform. This induces an innate motor behaviour enabling healthy flies to initiate flight and escape from the platform within seconds (<xref rid="awy198-B45" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B29" ref-type="bibr">Kochinke<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B19" ref-type="bibr">Eidhof<italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Ubiquitous Gdap2 knockdown significantly decreased the ability of flies to leave the platform, compared to their genetic background controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A and B). Whereas control animals had escaped the platform within 5 s, 34% of Gdap2 RNAi-1 and 67% of Gdap2 RNAi-2 animals were left on the platform after 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F3">Fig. 3</xref>A). Gdap2 knockdown flies mostly walked over and off the platform, indicating their inability to fly away. In agreement with this, Gdap2 RNAi-1<italic>Drosophila</italic> held their wings in a droopy posture in contrast to the normal wing posture of their genetic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We next monitored locomotor behaviour in Gdap2 knockdown models by tracing their locomotor paths over time in an open-field arena. Both RNAi lines showed reduced walking distance and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F3">Fig. 3</xref>C&#x2013;E).

        <title>Loss of Gdap2 increases susceptibility to oxidative stress and starvation</title>
        <p>No information is available about GDAP2 function in any organism. However, proteins containing macro or lipid-binding CRAL-TRIO domains have been linked to many important cellular processes such as signal transduction pathways, DNA repair, necrosis, apoptosis, cell differentiation and proliferation, and intracellular trafficking (<xref rid="awy198-B26" ref-type="bibr">Karras<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bankaitis<italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B24" ref-type="bibr">Han<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). All these processes are essential for a proper equilibrium between cellular stress, survival and death and have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including ARCAs (<xref rid="awy198-B32" ref-type="bibr">Lim<italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B49" ref-type="bibr">Smeets and Verbeek, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B14" ref-type="bibr">Didonna and Opal, 2016</xref>). Maintaining these equilibriums and adaptation to cellular stress is, among others, dependent on changes in gene expression (<xref rid="awy198-B6" ref-type="bibr">Borch Jensen<italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). We considered the possibility that<italic>Gdap2</italic> could be a stress-responsive gene and investigated differential<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression in control strains after induction of two types of cellular stress: paraquat to induce oxidative stress (<xref rid="awy198-B10" ref-type="bibr">Castello<italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) or nutrient depletion to induce starvation.<italic>Gdap2</italic> mRNA levels were consistently downregulated for both Control-1 and Control-2 flies after starvation and paraquat induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>A&#x2013;D). Relative<italic>Gdap2</italic> mRNA expression levels for both control strains significantly decreased to 70% or less after 3 h starvation and remained on similar levels after 6 h and 12 h starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>A and B). Relative<italic>Gdap2</italic> mRNA expression levels for both control strains significantly decreased to 80% or less after 6 h paraquat treatment and continued to decrease significantly to 50% or less after 12 h paraquat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>C and D). Because<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels responded to cellular stress, we next asked whether reduced<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels may increase the susceptibility to deleterious effects of starvation and paraquat treatment. Treated control strains lived significantly shorter compared to non-treated control and Gdap2 knockdown flies after starvation and paraquat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>E&#x2013;H). Importantly, Gdap2 knockdown flies, characterized by reduced<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels already in non-treated conditions, lived significantly shorter upon exposure to nutrient starvation and, dramatically, to paraquat, compared to treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>E&#x2013;H). The median survival time of Gdap2 knockdown animals during starvation compared to starved controls was slightly lower (45 h versus 49 h, 0.92 relative survival time in Gdap2 RNAi-1 animals; 37 h versus 48 h, 0.77 relative survival time in Gdap2 RNAi-2 animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>E&#x2013;F). The median survival time of Gdap2 knockdown animals treated with paraquat compared to paraquat-treated controls was 26 h versus 149 h (0.17 relative survival time) in Gdap2 RNAi-1 animals and 32 h versus 156 h (0.21 relative survival time) in Gdap2 RNAi-2 animals compared to their genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="awy198-F4">Fig. 4</xref>G&#x2013;H). We addressed the possibility that Gdap2 knockdown flies on paraquat die sooner due to increased levels of neurodegeneration in the central brain; however, we were not able to confirm this with cleaved-caspase-3 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Our results show that<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels change upon exposure to cellular stressors in control flies, and that decreased<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels in the knockdown flies increase the sensitivity against deleterious effects of oxidative stress and, to a minor degree, to nutrient deprivation. An abnormal response to cellular stress may thus contribute to the phenotypes observed in<italic>Drosophila</italic> GDAP2 knockdown models.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we report two unrelated individuals with compound heterozygous or homozygous gene-disruptive mutations in<italic>GDAP2.</italic> The main clinical theme in both individuals was cerebellar ataxia, which manifested in their fourth decade. They also developed spasticity, and dementia emerged in the patient with long follow-up time and eventual early death (Patient AW). This cognitive phenotype was paralleled by global cerebral atrophy accompanying the cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Neuropathological investigations confirmed clear degenerative changes in the cerebellum, but also involvement of the thalamus, substantia nigra, and pyramidal tracts that may underlie the other motor features. Using Montine&#x2019;s scoring system (<xref rid="awy198-B35" ref-type="bibr">Montine<italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) for amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, the low score of A0B2C0 argues against amyloid pathology as an alternative explanation of the co-emerging dementia. The AT8 immunoreactive tangles in the hippocampus and amygdala lead to a formal neuropathological diagnosis of primary age-related tauopathy (<xref rid="awy198-B12" ref-type="bibr">Crary<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). There were not enough features to consider a diagnosis of fronto-temporal lobe degeneration-TDP type B (<xref rid="awy198-B34" ref-type="bibr">Mackenzie<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Other theoretical substrates for the cognitive decline could be the bilateral thalamic lesions affecting the nucleus anterior and the pulvinar, or the cerebellum. Whether and how any of these mechanisms is related to<italic>GDAP2</italic> mutations is unclear. Further follow-up of Patient NIJ, who is still in an earlier disease stage, and the identification of more patients with<italic>GDAP2</italic> mutations will allow us to further delineate the GDAP2 loss-of-function phenotypic spectrum.</p>
      <p>The clearly gene-disruptive nature of the mutations, absence of homozygous<italic>GDAP2</italic> loss-of-function mutations in controls (<xref rid="awy198-B30" ref-type="bibr">Lek<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), and shared clinical presentation and time of onset strongly suggest that loss of GDAP2 function underlies this new ARCA subtype. As other biallelic<italic>GDAP2</italic> variants were absent in over 500 ataxia exomes at the Nijmegen and Miami sites, this is likely a rare cause of ARCA.</p>
      <p>The causality of<italic>GDAP2</italic> gene-disruptive mutations in cerebellar and global cerebral atrophy is supported by high GDAP2 expression levels in the human brain, which were increased in the human cerebellum during postnatal stages compared to other brain regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>A) and high GDAP2 expression levels in the cerebellum of mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>B). Further, modelling of GDAP2 loss-of-function in<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, an established model for movement disorders, resulted in locomotor defects and shortened lifespan, supporting an evolutionary role for GDAP2 in these processes. The origin of the<italic>Drosophila</italic> locomotor phenotypes need further investigation. Their early onset suggests a potential developmental component, whereas disease onset in GDAP2 patients is in adulthood. Decreased genetic redundancy within gene families and between molecular pathways in fly compared to humans may disable compensatory mechanisms, potentially accounting for this difference. Indeed,<italic>GDAP2</italic> is part of a gene family (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.treefam.org">www.treefam.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="awy198-B46" ref-type="bibr">Schreiber<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Moreover, numerous<italic>Drosophila</italic> models of other progressive neurodegenerative disorders also induce neurodevelopmental phenotypes, e.g. SCA5 (<xref rid="awy198-B33" ref-type="bibr">Lorenzo<italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), progressive myoclonus epilepsy (<xref rid="awy198-B18" ref-type="bibr">Ehaideb<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B42" ref-type="bibr">Praschberger<italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), hereditary spastic paraplegia type 30 (<xref rid="awy198-B27" ref-type="bibr">Kern<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and SCA with neuropathy (<xref rid="awy198-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dunlop<italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p>
      <p>Although<italic>GDAP2</italic> molecular function and mechanisms underlying its associated neurodegenerative pathology remain elusive, important hints are provided by its gene product.<italic>GDAP2</italic> was previously identified as one of the 10 cDNAs upregulated during neurite sprouting of a Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cell line upon expression of GD3 synthase and was therefore called &#x2018;ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein 2&#x2019;. GDAP1, another member of the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated family, has been described in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a degenerative peripheral nerve disorder, which may suggest a conserved role of GDAP proteins in neuronal maintenance and locomotor function. In spite of this, little similarity exists between GDAP2 and GDAP1 amino acid sequences (&lt;2%).</p>
      <p>The GDAP2 protein contains a unique combination of functional domains: a macro and a CRAL-TRIO domain (<xref rid="awy198-B1" ref-type="bibr">Aken<italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Only 11 macro domain-containing proteins exist in humans. The macro domain of GDAP2 is very similar to that of MacroD1/MacroD2 proteins, but has little affinity for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-derived metabolites; it has poly(A) affinity instead (<xref rid="awy198-B37" ref-type="bibr">Neuvonen and Ahola, 2009</xref>). Overall, macro domain-containing proteins have been described as sensors of cellular metabolic states and are involved in cellular redox homeostasis, DNA damage and repair, the formation of cytosolic stress granules that can protect mRNAs from degradation, apoptosis, and necrosis (<xref rid="awy198-B26" ref-type="bibr">Karras<italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B24" ref-type="bibr">Han<italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B41" ref-type="bibr">Posavec<italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B31" ref-type="bibr">Leung, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B20" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez Esquivel<italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Although it is not clear whether GDAP2 operates in these processes, it is noticeable that defects in these key pathways have been linked to many neurodegenerative disorders, including ARCAs (<xref rid="awy198-B32" ref-type="bibr">Lim<italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B4" ref-type="bibr">Barclay<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B48" ref-type="bibr">Sharma<italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B49" ref-type="bibr">Smeets and Verbeek, 2014</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B14" ref-type="bibr">Didonna and Opal, 2016</xref>). The CRAL-TRIO domain is a lipid-binding domain, and CRAL-TRIO-domain-only proteins are involved in lipid transport. Of note, CRAL-TRIO domains have been found in other genes causing ARCAs when mutated, including ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) caused by defects in &#x3B1;-TTP, and Cayman ataxia with loss of function of the caytaxin protein (<xref rid="awy198-B47" ref-type="bibr">Schuelke, 1993</xref>;<xref rid="awy198-B5" ref-type="bibr">Bomar<italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Multi-domain CRAL-TRIO containing proteins, such as GDAP2, are thought to have more complex functions in signal transduction, transport, and organelle biology, where they integrate lipid metabolism with other biochemical processes (<xref rid="awy198-B44" ref-type="bibr">Saito<italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This information suggests that GDAP2 might be involved in cellular metabolic and/or stress responses. In line with this, we demonstrated that in<italic>Drosophila Gdap2</italic> expression significantly decreases after stress induction in wild-type animals and that Gdap2 knockdown increases the sensitivity to deleterious effects of oxidative stress and, to a minor degree, to nutrient deprivation. Since Gdap2 knockdown flies also show shortened lifespan in non-stressed conditions, we considered the possibility that the decreased lifespan of Gdap2 knockdown flies upon stress are additive effects. However,<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels directly responded to stress exposure in wild-type animals. Also, the effect of the paraquat stressor, exerting a milder effect on the lifespan in controls, was very dramatic in Gdap2 knockdown flies compared to the more severe nutrient deprivation stressor. We therefore propose that at least the high susceptibility to paraquat goes beyond an additive effect. After 18-h paraquat induction, we were unable to show increased levels of apoptosis in the brains of GDAP2 knockdown models compared to genetic controls. This suggests that the decreased lifespan of the GDAP2 knockdown models upon stress might, at this stage, be a consequence of neuronal dysfunction instead of neuronal degeneration. This is supported by data from other genetic ataxias suggesting that neuronal dysfunction indeed precedes neuronal degeneration (<xref rid="awy198-B13" ref-type="bibr">Dell&#x2019;Orco<italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, fly brains would also need to be tested directly after organismal death, or the time window of stress induction that we tested may not be long enough to observe neuronal degeneration accumulating. Because of the strong deleterious of 25 mM paraquat on lifespan, additional experimental series with milder stressors may be more informative. Altered responses to cellular stress may thus reflect a direct role of GDAP2 in stress conditions.</p>
      <p>Gdap2 could be functioning in key homeostatic metabolic processes that are downregulated during cellular stress, to ensure proper activation or action of proteins protecting against stress. Prolonged downregulation of these processes might affect neuronal functioning and could be deleterious. An alternative explanation for our findings could be that decreased<italic>Gdap2</italic> expression levels upon stress could be a deleterious consequence of the stressor and part of the damaging process. Reduced levels of<italic>Gdap2</italic> prior to the stressor would then cause even faster or more severe damage. Further research is required to examine these primary inferences on the exact function of Gdap2. In both scenarios, however, stress susceptibility may contribute to the phenotypes observed in the<italic>Drosophila</italic> GDAP2 knockdown models and in individuals with biallelic<italic>GDAP2</italic> mutations.</p>
      <p>In summary, we define a new subtype of ARCA caused by gene-disruptive mutations in the<italic>GDAP2</italic> gene. The corresponding<italic>Drosophila</italic> model suggests that GDAP2 is an evolutionary conserved, potentially stress-dependent regulator that, when mutated, affects motor behaviour and lifespan.</p>
