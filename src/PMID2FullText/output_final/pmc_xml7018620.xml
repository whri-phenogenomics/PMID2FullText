    <p id="P3">Mucociliary clearance, the physiological process by which mammalian conducting airways expel pathogens and unwanted surface materials from the respiratory tract, depends on the coordinated function of multiple specialized cell types including basal stem cells, mucus-secreting goblet cells, motile ciliated cells, CFTR-rich ionocytes, and immune cells<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Bronchiectasis, a syndrome of pathological airway dilation associated with impaired mucociliary clearance, may occur sporadically or with Mendelian inheritance, such as in cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), and select immunodeficiencies<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Prior studies have identified mutations affecting ciliary structure and nucleation in PCD<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, but the regulation of mucociliary transport remains incompletely understood and therapeutic targets for modulating it are lacking. Herein we identify a bronchiectasis syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in <italic>NEK10</italic>, a protein kinase with previously unknown <italic>in vivo</italic> function in mammals. Genetically modified primary human airway cultures establish <italic>NEK10</italic> as a ciliated-cell specific kinase whose activity regulates the motile ciliary proteome to promote ciliary length and mucociliary transport, but which is dispensable for normal ciliary number, radial structure, and beat frequency. Together, these data identify a novel and likely targetable signaling axis which controls motile ciliary function in humans and has potential implications for other respiratory disorders characterized by impaired mucociliary clearance.</p>
    <p id="P4">A 31-year-old consanguineous woman was evaluated for idiopathic respiratory failure characterized by neonatal respiratory distress and recurrent bacterial sinopulmonary infections (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Chest imaging demonstrated extensive pan-lobar bronchiectasis without heterotaxy and nasal biopsies revealed normal ciliary radial ultrastructure (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency were ruled out after extensive clinical and genetic testing. Similar but milder findings were present in 2 siblings (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), strongly suggestive of autosomal recessive inheritance. Whole exome sequencing of affected individuals unexpectedly revealed homozygous intronic splice site mutations (NM_152534:c.1230+5G&gt;C, &#x201C;<italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup>&#x201D; hereafter) in <italic>NEK10</italic>, a serine/threonine kinase homologous to <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> nimA (&#x201C;never in mitosis a&#x201D;) but not previously implicated in human disease<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The functions of mammalian NEKs remain incompletely characterized; several, including NEK2 and NEK5/6/7/9 function like their fungal ortholog by regulating the cell cycle through phosphorylation of centrosome components and the mitotic spindle<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Mutations in NEK1 and NEK8 cause polycystic kidney phenotypes in mice<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, in line with a role in regulation of primary cilia. Recent reports have proposed roles for NEK10 in cancer cell DNA damage response<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and in teleost fish nervous system and body axis specification<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> but, to date, no published work suggests any roles for NEKs in the respiratory system.</p>
    <p id="P5">To begin to study the effects of <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> in the lung, we isolated and cultured control and proband bronchial epithelial cells (&#x201C;HBECs&#x201D;) obtained at the time of bilateral lung transplantation. Although <italic>NEK10</italic> mRNA was robustly expressed in airway tissue it was essentially undetectable both in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> and <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> HBECs, suggesting its expression might be restricted to mature airway cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We therefore differentiated control and patient-derived HBECs at an air-liquid interface (ALI), a well-validated method for generating airway epithelium <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, both control and mutant ALI samples demonstrated robust <italic>NEK10</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>) despite immunoblotting evidence that <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> encodes a loss of function allele (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). To elucidate the mechanism by which <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> impairs protein expression we sequenced full-length cDNAs from mutant ALI, revealing the mutation-dependent in-frame insertion of 7 amino acids which we suspected rendered NEK10 unstable (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). To test this hypothesis we expressed epitope-tagged NEK10 constructs in HEK293T cells and found, as in ALI cultures, that the mutant protein was severely under-expressed - supporting a destabilizing effect of <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> causing loss-of-function (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">These findings led us to wonder whether NEK10 mutations might underlie other cases of unexplained bronchiectasis. Indeed, further sequencing revealed 6 additional patients from 4 families harboring homozygous <italic>NEK10</italic> mutation and exhibiting bronchiectasis (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1e</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">1o</xref>). The first, an 11-year-old girl, had homozygous c.1869dupT mutation resulting in frameshift and premature stop (His624Serfs*4). The second, a 15-year-old girl, had homozygous c.2243C&gt;T mutation causing substitution of leucine for a highly conserved proline (Pro748Leu) within the kinase domain. The third, a 23-year-old woman, had homozygous c.1373+1G&gt;T mutation causing exon skipping, frameshift, and premature stop (Cys437Thrfs*9). The fourth, fifth, and sixth were siblings with homozygous c.2317C&gt;T mutation resulting in mutation of a highly conserved arginine to cysteine (Arg773Cys). Notably, clinical assays revealed normal nasal ciliary ultrastructure by EM, normal nasal nitric oxide (nNO) levels, no evidence of heterotaxy, and only very subtle abnormalities by clinical high-speed video-microscopy (HSVM) in all tested individuals, suggesting such patients might escape detection during standard PCD evaluation<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

    <p id="P7">Given NEK roles in cell cycle regulation, we initially hypothesized that NEK10 is required for the specification of one or more cell types involved in mucociliary clearance. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that <italic>NEK10</italic> is robustly induced during airway epithelial differentiation, coincident with the acquisition of markers for ciliated and secretory cells and the depletion of stem cell markers (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>).

    <p id="P8">To explore what functional roles NEK10 plays in MCCs, we imaged live ALI cultures with high-framerate phase contrast microscopy, exposing a striking reduction in overall ciliary motion in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> cultures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>).

Unlike control cultures, which robustly transport polystyrene beads added to the apical ALI surface, we noted near-absence of mucociliary transport (MCT) in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> ALI (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>), as well as reduction in depth of the periciliary liquid layer (PCL, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). We were surprised to measure normal ciliary beat frequency in mutant ALI (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>), again suggesting a mode of dysfunction distinct from classical PCD. While these data suggested a causative role for <italic>NEK10</italic> loss-of-function in MCC dysfunction, they could not rule out that secondary genetic or acquired changes in proband-derived cells were in fact responsible<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We therefore generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NEK10 loss-of-function ALI cultures (&#x201C;<italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup>&#x201D; hereafter) by genetically disrupting the NEK10 locus in wild-type HBECs.

    <p id="P9">Given a recent report of catalysis-independent roles for NEKs<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, we sought to understand whether kinase activity <italic>per se</italic> is necessary for NEK10 function in MCCs. We therefore generated <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> ALI with <italic>FOXJ1</italic> promoter-driven re-expression of NEK10<sup>WT</sup> or, alternatively, point mutants predicted to inactivate<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (NEK10<sup>K548R</sup>) or putatively hyperactivate (NEK10<sup>S684D</sup>, NEK10<sup>Y590A</sup>) activity based on prior studies of paralogous NEK kinases<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Despite sub-physiological expression of transduced NEK10 variants, live microscopy demonstrated a striking increase in motility upon expression of NEK10<sup>S684D</sup>, partial rescue with NEK10<sup>WT</sup> and NEK10<sup>Y590A</sup>, but no effect with catalytic-dead NEK10<sup>K548R</sup> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3g</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). &#x3BC;OCT demonstrated that CBF was again unaffected by NEK10 status but that particle transport was significantly increased upon expression of NEK10<sup>S684D</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3j</xref>). These data led us to ask whether ectopic activation of NEK10 signaling in wildtype ALI cultures could augment mucociliary transport to supraphysiological levels. Indeed, expression of NEK10<sup>WT</sup> or NEK10<sup>S684D</sup> under the control of the FOXJ1 promoter significantly increased transport velocity compared to catalytic-dead NEK10<sup>K548R</sup>, a phenotype also reproduced with the more transcriptionally active NEK10 promoter (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Together, these data establish (1) a ciliated cell-specific NEK10 kinase activity requirement for effective airway mucociliary transport, (2) that NEK10 activity is constrained by the serine 684 activation loop residue, and (3) that potentiating NEK10 activity may represent a strategy for augmenting mucociliary transport.</p>
    <p id="P10">We next turned our attention to understanding the mechanisms by which NEK10 regulates MCC function. To evaluate whether mutant MCCs harbor some physical abnormality we employed imaging flow cytometry (IFC), which allows the capture of thousands of single cells for statistically robust morphology analysis<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. After gating singlet MCCs from <italic>NEK10</italic>:eGFP ALI (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) we measured per-cell ciliary area as well as ciliary zone thickness, revealing a clear and statistically significant reduction in both parameters in mutant MCCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Representative single cells corroborated this finding, demonstrating a hypoplastic ciliary layer in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> MCCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). To validate this finding using an orthogonal method, we subjected <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> ALI to confocal IF against acetylated &#x3B1;-tubulin. We again found mutant ALI harbored strikingly abnormal, hypoplastic-appearing cilia (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> ALI phenocopied this morphology while NEK10<sup>S684D</sup>-complemented <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> ALI reversed it (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>), indicating this phenotype is specifically attributable to NEK10 kinase activity. As previously described human mutations<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> are known to impair the nucleation and density of motile cilia, we evaluated MCC basal body density by IF, but found no reduction to account for the <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> phenotype (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). In light of links between planar cell polarity (PCP) and ciliogenesis<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, we also confirmed that NEK10 activity is dispensable for MCC planar polarization (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Finally, in order to validate ALI culture findings in human patients, we compared airway tissue from the explanted lungs of the proband with airway from non-bronchiectatic as well as end-stage CF patients. As in ALI cultures (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4e</xref>), histological analysis revealed ciliary hypoplasia only in NEK10 mutant airway (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>) &#x2013; indicating this phenotype does not reflect a non-specific consequence of severe bronchiectasis and suggesting that NEK10 deficiency produces short motile cilia <italic>in vivo</italic>, a previously undescribed human genetic phenotype.</p>
    <p id="P11">As the size of motile cilia limits their structural analysis by light microscopy, we next subjected ALI preparations to 3 complementary modes of electron microscopic (EM) analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of intact ALI, like IF, revealed <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> and <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> ALI to harbor morphologically abnormal cilia of heterogeneous length with excess mucus accumulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). EM imaging of sectioned ALI cultures revealed an evident decrease in ciliary length in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>G&gt;C</italic></sup> ALI (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), but not undocked centrioles as in ciliary aplasia syndromes or ciliary tip &#x201C;ballooning&#x201D; as reported with certain intraflagellar transport (IFT) defects<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In order to precisely quantitate this length defect, we biochemically isolated axonemes from ALI cultures<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>) and subjected these preparations to negative stain EM followed by measurement of individual cilia.

    <p id="P12">In order to explore the biochemical functions of NEK10 in airway epithelium, we next performed iron-enrichment proteomics<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (LC-IMAC MS<sup>2</sup>), identifying a set of depleted phosphopeptides upon NEK10 inactivation in ALI (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Gene ontology analysis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> revealed these depleted peptides to be highly enriched for ciliary motility and axonemal assembly genes, suggesting a large complement of ciliary proteins are dysregulated upon NEK10 loss (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5d</xref>). To test this hypothesis directly, we analyzed the effects of NEK10 deletion on the set of proteins previously proteomically identified in airway cilia<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, exposing a striking and highly significant depletion of such ciliary phosphopeptides (median log<sub>2</sub> fold change &#x2212;1.06 (sgNEK10b), &#x2212;0.771 (sgNEK10c), <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Notably, while we observed similar findings upon analysis of peptides mapping to annotated PCD genes, we saw little to no depletion of peptides from non-PCD ciliopathy genes, consistent with NEK10 specifically regulating motile ciliogenesis (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5e</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Peptides from virtually all classes of motile ciliary genes were depleted in <italic>NEK10</italic><sup><italic>KO</italic></sup> ALI (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>) including axonemal motors, IFT components, central pair constituents, and ciliary length control proteins - indicating that a diverse array of the ciliary proteome is directly or indirectly dysregulated upon NEK10 loss and providing a rich data set for future efforts to dissect its target network.</p>
    <p id="P13">In summary, here we describe a novel human disease caused by NEK10 deficiency and characterized by pathologically short motile cilia as evidenced by multiple orthogonal assays in physiologically-relevant human airway preparations. In light of <italic>NEK10&#x2019;</italic>s highly cell-type restricted expression in our own data and that of recently generated cell atlases<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> as well as the absence of extra-respiratory phenotypes in our patients, this gene does not appear essential for primary ciliogenesis in humans as has been previously proposed<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, instead likely specifically controlling MCC function. Indeed, as protozoan beating cilia<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and flagella<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> length are regulated by distant <italic>NEK</italic> homologs, analogous pathways likely operate in metazoan MCCs to tune ciliary function to physiological needs. While the central role of NEK10 in potentiating mucociliary clearance is clear from our study, the mechanistic basis for this activity remains to be fully elucidated as our current proteomic data cannot unambiguously distinguish direct phosphorylation effects from secondary protein abundance changes. We are optimistic that future work will clarify the full repertoire of direct and indirect NEK10 targets in ciliated cells.</p>
    <p id="P14">In parallel with these scientific insights, our work has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis. In particular, the identification of multiple NEK10-mutant kindreds in whom ciliary EM, nNO, and HSVM are all essentially normal suggests standard algorithms for exonerating PCD may fail to capture such patients and others with mechanistically similar motile ciliopathies. Indeed, as prior studies have suggested ciliary shortening (for example due to smoking<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>) may play a role in impaired mucociliary clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>, our results suggest this relatively subtle histological abnormality should be more regularly evaluated for in patients with otherwise unexplained mucus clearance deficiencies, as it may be more common than currently appreciated. Finally, as this report is the first directly implicating a kinase mutation in ciliary dyskinesia, it opens the door both to understanding new regulatory networks in ciliated cells and, based on this understanding, to potentially targeting this signaling axis in more common diseases of mucociliary clearance where promotion of mucociliary transport may be therapeutically beneficial<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p>

The resulting 8-bit monochrome videos were processed in ImageJ/FIJI as follows: each 300 frame stack was duplicated and a new 299 frame stack (the &#x201C;difference stack&#x201D;) generated by subtracting the (<italic>n+1</italic>)th frame from the <italic>n</italic>th frame. The mean of every pixel in the difference stack was then calculated and the resultant data output to a single TIF file visually representing the average pixel intensity change over the course of video, a surrogate for motion.

In brief, periciliary liquid layer (PCL) depth and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) were directly assessed via cross-sectional images of the airway epithelium with high resolution (~1&#x3BC;m) and high acquisition speed (20,480 Hz A-line rate resulting in 40 frames/s at 512 A-lines per frame across 1mm lateral range). Quantitative analysis of images was performed in FIJI/ImageJ. To establish CBF, previously published custom code in Matlab (Mathworks) was used to quantify Fourier-transformed reflectance modulations of beating cilia. PCL depth was characterized directly by geometric measurement of the respective layers. For measurement of mucociliary transport (MCT), native mucus was washed away completely with PBS and 0.5&#x3BC;m polystyrene beads (Invitrogen F8813) were added to the apical ALI surface prior to imaging. Particle tracking was performed using MosaicSuite in ImageJ<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and the resulting particle tracks analyzed in Matlab. Particles included for analysis were within 90&#x3BC;m of the epithelial surface, present for at least 20 frames (0.5s), and had a velocity vector within 10&#xBA; of horizontal. Hypothesis testing was performed by Mann Whitney U-test or, when necessary to control for environmental (temperature, humidity, etc.) and instrument changes between imaging sessions, by linear mixed effects model.</p>

        <p id="P29">Single cells were generated from mature ALI as above, fixed in 2% PFA, and resuspended in PBS before analysis on an ImageStream<sup>X</sup> MkII instrument (Amnis). The gating strategy was as follows: Starting with unclipped events using a centroid X gate, we obtained in-focus cells using a gradient RMS gate. We next employed a liberal area vs. aspect ratio gate (R1) to exclude clumps, followed by an area vs. GFP intensity plot to gate on GFP+ cells (R2), followed by a GFP morphology mask vs aspect ratio gate (R3) to exclude GFP doublets, and followed again by a final doublet removal step again gated on brightfield (R4). We finally gated on R6, cells with a minimal mean pixel value of 45 in the GFP channel. This strategy yielded 4,108 imaged single cells from NEK10<sup>WT</sup> and 3,513 imaged single cells from NEK10<sup>G&gt;C</sup> ALI samples. From this parent population of unclipped, singlet, in-focus, GFP-positive cells we defined masks of whole cells and GFP-positive cell bodies. Major axis difference was calculated by subtracting the major axis of the GFP mask from the whole cell mask, and area difference was likewise calculated by subtracting the GFP mask area from the whole cell mask area. Null hypothesis testing was performed using the 2-tailed Student&#x2019;s t-test. For gallery images, we selected representative images centered on the medians of the indicated populations.</p>
