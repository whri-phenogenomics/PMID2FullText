        <p id="Par1">The genetic etiologies of more than half of rare diseases remain unknown. Standardized genome sequencing and phenotyping of large patient cohorts provide an opportunity for discovering the unknown etiologies, but this depends on efficient and powerful analytical methods. We built a compact database, the &#x2018;Rareservoir&#x2019;, containing the rare variant genotypes and phenotypes of 77,539 participants sequenced by the 100,000 Genomes Project. We then used the Bayesian genetic association method BeviMed to infer associations between genes and each of 269 rare disease classes assigned by clinicians to the participants. We identified 241 known and 19 previously unidentified associations. We validated associations with <italic>ERG</italic>, <italic>PMEPA1</italic> and <italic>GPR156</italic> by searching for pedigrees in other cohorts and using bioinformatic and experimental approaches. We provide evidence that (1) loss-of-function variants in the Erythroblast Transformation Specific (ETS)-family transcription factor encoding gene <italic>ERG</italic> lead to primary lymphoedema, (2) truncating variants in the last exon of transforming growth factor-&#x3B2; regulator <italic>PMEPA1</italic> result in Loeys&#x2013;Dietz syndrome and (3) loss-of-function variants in <italic>GPR156</italic> give rise to recessive congenital hearing impairment. The Rareservoir provides a lightweight, flexible and portable system for synthesizing the genetic and phenotypic data required to study rare disease cohorts with tens of thousands of participants.</p>

      <p id="Par3">Collectively, rare diseases affect 1 in 20 people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, but fewer than half of the approximately 10,000 cataloged rare diseases have a resolved genetic etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Standardized genome sequencing (GS) of large, phenotypically diverse collections of patients with rare diseases enables etiological discovery across a wide range of pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> while boosting genetic diagnostic rates for patients. The 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP), the largest GS study of patients with rare diseases to date, sequenced 34,523 UK National Health Service patients with rare diseases and 43,016 of their unaffected relatives. The linked genetic and phenotypic data of 100KGP participants were then made available to researchers through a web portal called the Genomics England Research Environment. The scale and complexity of such large GS datasets and the hierarchical nature of patient phenotype coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> induce numerous bioinformatic and statistical challenges. Most importantly, the full genotype data from GS studies of tens of thousands of individuals are typically stored in unmodifiable files many terabytes in size, leading to high storage and processing costs. Recently developed frameworks, such as Hail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and OpenCGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, afford greater flexibility. However, they are designed to capture genotypes for variants across the full minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum, from rare (MAF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.1%) to common (MAF&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;5%) variants. To accommodate large numbers of genotypes, they depend on distributed storage systems and require numerous software packages, hindering deployment. We developed a database schema, the &#x2018;Rareservoir&#x2019;, for working with rare variant genotypes and patient phenotypes flexibly and efficiently. We deployed a Rareservoir only 5.5&#x2009;GB in size of 100KGP data and applied the Bayesian statistical method BeviMed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> to identify genetic associations between coding genes and each of the 269 rare disease classes assigned to patients by clinicians. Of the previously unknown associations that we identified, we followed up the most plausible subset in confirmatory analytical and experimental work.</p>

        <title>The Rareservoir</title>
        <p id="Par4">Relational databases (RDBs) provide a unified, centralized structure for storing, querying and modifying data of multiple underlying types. In principle, an RDB could provide a convenient foundation for the analysis of genotypes, variants, genes, participants and statistical results, but they cannot accommodate tables of the scale required to store exome or genome-wide genotypes in a moderately sized cohort. An RDB can, however, accommodate a sparse representation of genotypes corresponding to rare variants only, which encompass almost all variants having a large effect on rare disease risk. We developed an RDB schema, the Rareservoir, and complementary build procedure for the analysis of rare diseases, which by default, stores genotypes corresponding to variants for which all population-specific MAFs are likely to be &lt;0.1%. This reduces the number of stored genotypes in a large study by about 99% (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The Rareservoir encodes variants as 64-bit integers (&#x2018;RSVR IDs&#x2019;) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which can represent 99.3% of variants encountered in practice without loss of information. RSVR IDs occupy a single column and increase numerically with respect to genomic position, allowing fast location-based queries within a simple database structure. To support the build process of a Rareservoir, we developed a complementary software package called &#x2018;rsvr&#x2019; (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The package includes tools to annotate variants with MAF information from control databases (for example, gnomAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>), pathogenicity scores (for example, combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>) and predicted Sequence Ontology (SO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> consequences with respect to a set of transcripts. We use a 64-bit integer (&#x2018;CSQ ID&#x2019;) to record the consequences for interacting variant/transcript pairs, where each bit encodes one of the possible consequences, ordered by severity. Encoding the consequences in this way is efficient and enables succinct queries that threshold or sort based on severity of impact. The Rareservoir also contains a table with genetically derived data for each sample (including ancestry, sex and membership of a maximal set of unrelated participants) and a table of &#x2018;case sets&#x2019; storing the rare disease classes assigned to each participant.</p>

        <title>BeviMed infers 241 known and 19 unknown genetic associations</title>
        <p id="Par5">We built a Rareservoir, 5.5&#x2009;GB in size, containing 11.9 million rare exonic and splicing single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions or deletions (indels) affecting canonical transcripts of protein-coding genes in Ensembl v.104 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>) from a merged variant call format file (VCF) containing genotype calls for 77,539 participants, including 29,741 probands, in the Rare Diseases Main Programme of the 100KGP (Data Release v.13) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). During enrollment to the 100KGP, expert clinicians used the clinical characteristics of each affected participant to assign them to one or more of 220 &#x2018;Specific Diseases&#x2019;. The Specific Diseases are hierarchically arranged into 88 &#x2018;Disease Sub Groups&#x2019;, each of which belongs to 1 of 20 &#x2018;Disease Groups&#x2019;. Whereas the eligibility criteria for many Specific Diseases aligned to the same or closely related rare diseases, for others such as &#x2018;Intellectual disability&#x2019;, the criteria were broader and encompassed diverse genetic etiologies. We generated 269 analytical case sets corresponding to all distinct Specific Diseases and Disease Sub Groups, ranging in size from 5,809 to one proband, and stored them in the Rareservoir (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We included these two levels of the phenotyping hierarchy to account for heterogeneity in presentation or diagnosis among cases sharing the same genetic etiology, with the aim of boosting power to identify statistical genetic associations.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>BeviMed analysis of the 100KGP.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Bars showing the size of each case set used for the genetic association analyses grouped by Disease Group and coloured by type (Disease Sub Group or Specific Disease).

        <p id="Par6">Using the Bayesian statistical method BeviMed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, we obtained a posterior probability of association (PPA) between each of the 19,663 protein-coding genes and each of the 269 rare disease classes. BeviMed computes posterior probabilities over a baseline model of no association and competing association models, each of which assumes a particular mode of inheritance (MOI; dominant or recessive) and consequence class of etiological variant (in this study, high impact, moderate impact or 5&#x2032; untranslated region (UTR)). The PPA is obtained by summing the posterior probabilities over all association models. The association model with the greatest posterior probability (the modal model) determines the inferred MOI and class of etiological variant. Conditional on an association model, BeviMed models the pathogenicity of each included rare variant. In the model, participants with at least one pathogenic allele (under a dominant MOI) or at least as many pathogenic alleles as the ploidy (under a recessive MOI) have a pathogenic configuration of alleles, which determines their risk of case status. For each rare disease class, we selected a set of unrelated cases based on pedigree information provided by the 100KGP and compared them with participants not in the case set who belonged to different pedigrees and to a maximal set of unrelated participants, also provided by the 100KGP. To account for correlation between case sets, we only recorded the association for each gene having the highest PPA within a given Disease Group. Using a significance threshold of PPA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.95, we identified 260 significant associations, 241 of which were documented by the PanelApp gene panel database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, an expert-curated and annotated resource containing gene lists with high, medium or low levels of prior supporting evidence of causality for rare diseases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Of the 241 known associations that we identified, 43 (17.8%) were with Disease Sub Groups. For example, within each of the nine known genes associated with the Disease Sub Group &#x2018;Posterior segment abnormalities&#x2019;, the set of cases explained by variants with a conditional posterior probability of pathogenicity &gt;&#x2009;0.8 comprised participants encompassing multiple Specific Diseases (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This demonstrates that participants with different Specific Diseases belonging to the same Disease Sub Group sometimes share defects in the same gene, which confirms that treating Disease Sub Groups, not just Specific Diseases, as case sets boosts statistical power.</p>
        <p id="Par7">Of the 241 associations identified as previously known according to PanelApp, 237 (98.3%) had an inferred MOI that was consistent with the MOIs listed for the relevant gene. Of these, the consistent MOI was found in the matched panel (223 associations), in the notes for the matched panel (5 associations) or in the MOIs listed for an alternative relevant panel (9 associations) in PanelApp (Source Data Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This provided independent evidence that the genetic associations we labeled as known (without reference to MOI information) are genuinely supported by evidence in the literature, further demonstrating the accuracy of BeviMed&#x2019;s inference. Of the four known associations with an inferred MOI that was incongruous with PanelApp, two had supporting evidence for the inferred MOI in the literature that was absent from PanelApp: <italic>EDA</italic> with dominant &#x2018;Ectodermal dysplasia without a known gene mutation&#x2019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and <italic>AICDA</italic> with dominant &#x2018;Primary immunodeficiency&#x2019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The two associations with an MOI that was unsupported in the literature were between <italic>UCHL1</italic> and dominant &#x2018;Inherited optic neuropathies&#x2019; and between <italic>SLC39A8</italic> and dominant &#x2018;Intellectual disability&#x2019;.</p>
        <p id="Par8">Among 5,253 of the probands included in our analysis, the table of clinically reported variants available from the 100KGP Rare Diseases Main Programme at the time of this study comprised 4,907 distinct variants that had been classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in 1,863 genes. For 855 of these genes, etiological variants had been reported for only one family, suggesting that many genes that are etiological in the 100KGP are not identifiable by statistical association. Nevertheless, across the 260 associations identified by BeviMed, 2,536 distinct rare variants had a posterior probability of pathogenicity &gt;&#x2009;0.8 conditional on the modal model and were observed as part of a pathogenic configuration of alleles in a case (Source Data Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Interestingly, among the subset of 2,485 variants contributing to the 241 known associations, only 1,604 featured in the table of clinically reported variants.</p>
        <p id="Par9">We found 19 previously unidentified genetic associations. To select a shortlist for further investigation, we assigned a plausibility score (range 0&#x2013;3) based on three sources of additional evidence (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). First, we considered evidence of purifying selection from gnomAD v.2.1.1. Any dominant associations with high-impact variants in a gene having a probability of loss-of-function intolerance (pLI) &gt;0.9 or with moderate-impact variants in a gene having a <italic>Z</italic> score&#x2009;&gt;2 were considered to be supported by population genetic metrics of purifying selection. To avoid disadvantaging recessive associations, which are unlikely to leave a detectable signature of purifying selection in gnomAD even if genuine, they were considered to be supported by default. Second, we considered cosegregation data: any association for which variants having a posterior probability of pathogenicity conditional on the modal model &gt;0.8 tracked with case status in at least three additional family members and for which no affected relatives lacked the pertinent variants were considered to be supported by cosegregation. Third, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature for each gene and made a subjective assessment of whether an association was supported by biological function or previously known disease associations for related genes. In total, three genetic associations had a plausibility score of three and were, therefore, investigated further by gathering additional experimental evidence and looking for replication in other sequenced rare disease collections.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Plausibility scoring of the 19 previously unknown genetic associations identified by BeviMed</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene</th><th>Case set</th><th>Level</th><th>Cases</th><th>Controls</th><th>Variant class</th><th>MOI</th><th>pLI</th><th><italic>Z</italic></th><th>Cosegregation evidence</th><th>Biological function and existing disease associations</th><th>Score</th><th>Replication</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>ERG</italic></td><td>Primary lymphoedema</td><td>SD</td><td>94</td><td>55,400</td><td>High</td><td>Dom</td><td><bold>0.96</bold></td><td>2.53</td><td><bold>Cosegregation in 2 affected and 1 unaffected relatives (mosaicism in 1 affected parent)</bold></td><td><bold>ETS-family transcription factor ERG is a critical regulator of endothelial lineage specification, vascular development, angiogenesis, and endothelial homeostasis</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup></td><td>3</td><td>Internal (case enrolled for a different SD)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>GPR156</italic></td><td>Congenital hearing impairment</td><td>SD</td><td>510</td><td>54,739</td><td>High</td><td><bold>Rec</bold></td><td>0</td><td>1.04</td><td><bold>Cosegregation in 2 affected and 4 unaffected relatives</bold></td><td><bold>G protein-coupled receptor that regulates hair cell orientation in mechanosensory epithelia including in murine auditory epithelium</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></td><td>3</td><td>Riyadh</td></tr><tr><td><italic>PMEPA1</italic></td><td>FTAAD</td><td>SD</td><td>574</td><td>54,858</td><td>High</td><td>Dom</td><td><bold>0.94</bold></td><td>1.21</td><td><bold>Cosegregation in 3 affected relatives and distinctive phenotypic features</bold></td><td><bold>Negative regulator of TGF&#x3B2; signaling</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup><bold>; aberrant TGF&#x3B2; signaling is implicated in multiple Mendelian aortopathies</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup></td><td>3</td><td>100KGP pilot, Antwerp, Tokyo</td></tr><tr><td><italic>FMN1</italic></td><td>Congenital hearing impairment</td><td>SD</td><td>510</td><td>54,738</td><td>High</td><td><bold>Rec</bold></td><td>0</td><td>-1.53</td><td>Cosegregation in 2 unaffected relatives.</td><td><bold>Formin family protein involved in linear actin and microtubule polymerization</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup><bold>; pathogenic variants in the formin DIAPH1 cause hearing loss via cytoskeletal disruption in auditory stereocilia</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup></td><td>2</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>LRRC7</italic></td><td>Intellectual disability</td><td>SD</td><td>5,529</td><td>46,401</td><td>High</td><td>Dom</td><td><bold>1.00</bold></td><td>3.60</td><td/><td><bold>Brain-specific scaffold protein in postsynaptic densities</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup><bold>; LRRC7-inactivated mice have a neurobehavioral phenotype</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup></td><td>2</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>TUFT1</italic></td><td>Epidermolysis bullosa</td><td>SD</td><td>32</td><td>55,459</td><td>High</td><td><bold>Rec</bold></td><td>0</td><td>0.90</td><td><bold>Cosegregation in 1 affected and 4 unaffected relatives</bold></td><td>Acidic protein that mediates dental enamel mineralisation.</td><td>2</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>USP33</italic></td><td>Extreme early-onset hypertension</td><td>SD</td><td>182</td><td>55,305</td><td>High</td><td>Dom</td><td>0.86</td><td><bold>2.10</bold></td><td/><td><bold>Deubiquitinating enzyme implicated in multiple cellular processes, including regulation of expression of the &#x3B2;2-adrenergic receptor</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup><bold>, a critical regulator of circulatory function and blood pressure</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup></td><td>2</td><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>ARPC3</italic></td><td>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</td><td>SD</td><td>549</td><td>54,856</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Dom</td><td>0.22</td><td>0.39</td><td/><td><bold>Component of the Arp2/3 complex that regulates polymerization of F-actin, abundant in axonal neurofilaments; multiple Mendelian axonal filamentopathies manifest as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease</bold><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup><bold>, and</bold>

        <p id="Par11">The affected father of the proband with the variant encoding p.S182Afs*22 was called homozygous for the reference allele, initially suggesting a lack of cosegregation of the variant with the disease in that pedigree. However, a review of the GS read alignments for the father revealed that 2 of the 48 reads overlapping that position supported the alternative allele. Specifically, these reads contained a deletion of a single G within the central poly-G tract of the motif &#x2018;AGCTGGGGGTGAG&#x2019;. To assess whether this could be the result of erroneous sequencing, we counted the number of such reads in the 77,539 genomes in the 100KGP and found that the proband and the father were the only two with more than one such read. This indicated that these reads in the father were unlikely to be erroneous but instead, that he was mosaic (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), consistent with the observation that his lymphoedema became clinically apparent over two decades later than his daughter, indicating milder disease. A further 130 samples collected through the 100KGP had a single read containing the deletion. This number was consistent with observations in the 80 other exonic loci that contain the same 13-base pair (bp) motif (mean 99.67 samples, range 4&#x2013;149 samples), suggesting that, rather than being mosaic, the 130 samples contained individual sequencing errors. Furthermore, none of the participants who gave these samples had been assigned the Specific Disease &#x2018;Primary lymphoedema&#x2019;.</p>

However, little is known about the contribution of ERG to lymphatic development or how primary lymphoedema could arise from loss-of-function <italic>ERG</italic> variants that affect different parts of the ERG protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Total cellular expression of ERG detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in purified RNA and by immunoblotting of protein extracts was the same in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cell (HDLECs) as human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,e</xref>, respectively). Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured HDLECs showed that ERG expression colocalized with the lymphatic endothelial cell nuclear marker PROX1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), a finding confirmed in vivo by immunostaining whole mounts of ear skin from mice at 3 weeks after birth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). The positions of the p.S182Afs*22 and p.T224Rfs*15 variants suggest nonsense-mediated decay and haploinsufficiency as a possible disease mechanism. The other two variants, however, are located in the final exon of ERG and may, therefore, evade nonsense-mediated decay. We studied both types of variant in more detail to explore potential disease mechanisms. In HEK293 cells, which do not express endogenous ERG, overexpression of wild-type ERG cDNA recapitulated the nuclear expression pattern observed in the HDLEC and mouse ear skin models. However, overexpression of ERG mutant cDNAs resulted in mislocalization of ERG outside of the nucleus, in the cytosol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h,i</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), preventing it from binding to DNA and exerting its function as a transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Together, these data confirm high levels of ERG expression within the nuclei of the lymphatic endothelium consistent with a transcription regulatory function during lymphangiogenesis. They also suggest that in the primary lymphoedema cases, defective lymphangiogenesis may result from reduced ERG availability in the nucleus because of either haploinsufficiency resulting from nonsense-mediated decay or mislocalization.</p>

        <title>Variants in <italic>PMEPA1</italic> result in Loeys&#x2013;Dietz syndrome</title>
        <p id="Par13">BeviMed identified a dominant genetic association between high-impact variants in <italic>PMEPA1</italic> and the Specific Disease &#x2018;Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm disease&#x2019; (FTAAD). The variant with the highest conditional probability of pathogenicity was an insertion of one cytosine within a seven-cytosine stretch in the last exon of the canonical Ensembl transcript ENST00000341744.8. This variant, which is predicted to induce a p.S209Qfs*3 frameshift, was observed in three FTAAD pedigrees of European ancestry in the 100KGP discovery cohort. We replicated the association in three additional collections of cases. First, the same variant was identified independently in eight affected members of three pedigrees of Japanese ancestry in a separate Japanese patient group. Second, a single-cytosine deletion within the same polycytosine stretch as the previous variant, and encoding p.S209Afs*61, was found in an FTAAD case enrolled in a separate collection of 2,793 participants in the 100KGP Pilot Programme. Lastly, we identified a family in Belgium wherein the affected members carried a 5-bp deletion in the same stretch of polycytosines inducing a frameshift two residues upstream of the other two variants (p.P207Qfs*3).</p>
        <p id="Par14">All pedigrees exhibited dominant inheritance of aortic aneurysm disease with incomplete penetrance and skeletal features including pectus deformity, scoliosis and arachnodactyly with complete penetrance, which cosegregated with the respective variants in genotyped participants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). To assess whether <italic>PMEPA1</italic> families affected by FTAAD form a phenotypically distinct subgroup, we analyzed the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms assigned to the 593 FTAAD families in both programs of the 100KGP. Using a permutation-based method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> based on the semantic similarity measure of Resnik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we found that the four 100KGP <italic>PMEPA1</italic> families were significantly more similar to each other than to other FTAAD families chosen at random (<italic>P</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;5.7&#x2009;&#xD7;&#x2009;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>).

        <p id="Par16">BeviMed identified a recessive genetic association between high-impact variants in <italic>GPR156</italic> and the Specific Disease &#x2018;Congenital hearing impairment&#x2019;. Two high-impact variants in <italic>GPR156</italic> were responsible for the strong evidence of association: a 1-bp insertion predicting p.S207Vfs*113 and a 1-bp insertion predicting p.P718Lfs*86 with respect to the canonical Ensembl transcript ENST00000464295.6. One family contained two affected siblings who were both homozygous for the p.S207Vfs*113 variant inherited from heterozygous parents.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par19">The standardization of GS within a health care system, together with powerful frameworks for genetic and phenotypic data processing and statistical analysis, promises to advance the resolution of the remaining unknown etiologies of rare diseases. We have developed a lightweight and easily deployable RDB, the Rareservoir, for genetic analysis of rare diseases using approaches such as BeviMed. In one unified analysis, we identified 260 associations, of which 241 had been published previously in a body of work spanning several decades of genetics research. Our results give an upper bound on the false discovery rate of 7.3%. In contrast, a recent analysis of 57,000 samples in the 100KGP reported 249 known and 579 previously unidentified associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, giving an upper bound on the false discovery rate of 70%, which suggests that our analytical approach has a greater specificity for a given sensitivity. The associations spanned 86 disease classes across a wide range of organ systems. Interestingly, only 64% of the variants contributing substantially to the known associations were present in the table of clinically reported variants available at the time of this study. This suggests that, as cohorts grow larger, the results of statistical inference could help guide the clinical reporting process. The case sets we used in our genetic association analysis were based on the formal disease classifications used by the 100KGP. Some of the case sets, such as &#x2018;Intellectual disability&#x2019; (5,529 probands), are particularly large and likely to be highly genetically heterogeneous, potentially limiting the power of our analyses. Careful partitioning of heterogeneous case sets using individual-level HPO terms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> has the potential to boost power. Of the 19 previously unidentified associations, we shortlisted, replicated and validated three. These three etiologies involve genes that had not previously been implicated in any of these human diseases. The remaining 16 associations include further plausible hypotheses. For example, <italic>LRRC7</italic>, which we identified to be associated with intellectual disability, encodes a brain-specific protein in postsynaptic densities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and LRRC7-deficient mice exhibit a neurobehavioral phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. <italic>USP33</italic>, which we found to be associated with early-onset hypertension, encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme implicated in regulating expression of the &#x3B2;2-adrenergic receptor regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. These and other candidates will require replication and validation before they can be considered causative genes.</p>
      <p id="Par20">The present study has several limitations. First, approximately 82% of the participants in the 100KGP are of European ancestry. While this percentage is in line with the proportion of residents in England and Wales reporting their ethnic group as white in the 2011 UK census (86%), its large magnitude constrains power to identify causative variants specific to other ancestry groups. Second, of the 269 case sets analyzed, 28 contained fewer than five probands, limiting power to identify the causes of the corresponding disease classes and highlighting the need for continued enrollment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Third, we have only considered SNVs and indels in coding genes. The exploration of structural variants and of rare variation in noncoding genes and in regulatory elements of the genome may help identify further etiologies. Lastly, we focused our attention on monogenic models of rare disorders, even though the genetic etiologies of certain rare diseases may be polygenic. In addition, important variation in clinical presentation of monogenic disorders may be explained by polygenic effects. These limitations point toward multiple promising avenues of future research to uncover the remaining unknown genetic determinants of rare diseases.</p>

        <title>Motivation for developing a sparse RDB</title>
        <p id="Par21">Computational approaches for discovering the etiologies of rare diseases typically depend on the analysis of a heterogeneous set of files, each of which can be very large and follow a distinct convention. Genotypes, for example, are ordinarily stored in VCFs containing data for one sample or for multiple samples. In the latter case, the data are usually distributed in files covering many different &#x2018;chunks&#x2019; of the reference genome. Variant-level information, such as consequence predictions or pathogenicity scores, is typically encoded in strings that require extensive parsing to decode, either from within the VCFs containing the genotypes or in separate files. Modifying genotype or annotation files (for example, to incorporate newly generated data) requires rewriting files in their entirety. Phenotype data, pedigree data and the results of statistical inference are stored in a further set of files. Consequently, analyses are often burdensome to conduct and prone to error. Frameworks, such as Hail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and OpenCGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, afford greater flexibility, but they depend on the centrally organized deployment of a distributed storage system, hindering usability and portability.</p>
        <p id="Par22">RDBs are widely used, mature technologies, well known for their speed, reliability, flexibility, structure and extensibility. In the context of rare diseases, an RDB can in principle render the modification, combination and addition of data on samples, variants, genes and other entities efficient, reliable and straightforward to implement using a single query language. Unfortunately, the performance of RDBs degrades substantially when the number of records in a table reaches several billion, and the number of genotypes in a cohort the size of the 100KGP easily surpasses this threshold. However, the MAFs of pathogenic variants with strong effects on rare disease risk are typically kept below 1/1,000 by negative selection, and the proportion of nonhomozygous reference genotypes for variants within that MAF stratum is only about 1% of the total (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Consequently, it is possible to construct a compact RDB that includes virtually all the pathogenic variants even in a large cohort such as the 100KGP. This provides an opportunity for exploiting the benefits of a single unified RDB containing the nonhomozygous genotypes of rare variants upon which to conduct the entirety of the etiological discovery process. Furthermore, it provides a natural foundation for developing web applications for the multidisciplinary review of genetic, phenotypic, statistical and other data.</p>

        <title>Rareservoir</title>
        <p id="Par23">The Rareservoir is an RDB schema and a complementary software package rsvr for working with rare disease data. The database stores data including rare variant genotypes, variant annotations, phenotypes, sample information and pedigrees (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), but it can be extended arbitrarily. A Rareservoir is built through a series of steps from a set of input data and parameters (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The &#x2018;bcftools&#x2019; program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> extracts (&#x2018;bcftools view&#x2019;) and normalizes (&#x2018;bcftools norm&#x2019;) variants from either a set of single-sample genome variant call format files (gVCFs) or from a merged VCF. In all steps of the procedure, variants are encoded as RSVR IDs using the &#x2018;rsvr enc&#x2019; tool. Merged VCFs typically contain cohort-wide variant quality information in the FILTER column, which can be used to select variants for processing. However, this is not readily obtained from single gVCFs. To address this, we developed the &#x2018;rsvr depth&#x2019; tool, which computes variant quality pass rates at all positions in the genome based on a random subsample of gVCFs. If the input is a merged VCF, an internal (that is, within-VCF) allele frequency threshold is applied with bcftools to filter out internally common variants. If the input is a set of single-sample gVCFs, internally common variants are filtered out in two steps, for computational efficiency. First, a set of variants that are statistically almost certain to be common based on a random sample of gVCFs is identified&#x2014;by default, the variants for which a one-sided binomial test under the null hypothesis that the MAF&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01 is rejected at a significance level of 10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup> (done using the &#x2018;rsvr tabulate&#x2019; tool). Second, all gVCFs are read sequentially, filtering out the variants identified in the previous step (using the &#x2018;rsvr mix&#x2019; tool) and those for which the pass rates identified with &#x2018;rsvr depth&#x2019; do not meet the threshold. Retained genotypes are then loaded into a temporary genotype table in the database in order to apply the final internal allele frequency filter by executing an SQL &#x2018;DELETE&#x2019; statement. These variants are then annotated with gnomAD &#x2018;probabilistic minor allele frequency&#x2019; (PMAF) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> using the &#x2018;rsvr pmaf&#x2019; tool. The PMAF score is calculated with respect to a given allele frequency threshold <italic>t</italic> by evaluating a binomial test (at a significance threshold of 0.05) on the observed frequency of the variant under the null hypothesis that the variant has an allele frequency of <italic>t</italic>. If in any gnomAD population, the null is rejected for <italic>t</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001 and the allele count is at least two, the score is set to zero. If the null is rejected for <italic>t</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001, the score is set to one. If the null is not rejected, the score is set to two. Finally, if the variant is absent from gnomAD, the score is set to three. For the nonpseudoautosomal dominant regions of chromosome X, only allele counts for males are used in calculations. Variants are then additionally annotated with their CADD phred scores using the &#x2018;rsvr ann&#x2019; program and loaded into the VARIANT table. At this point, variants in the VARIANT and GENOTYPE table that have a PMAF score of zero may be deleted because they are unlikely to be involved in rare diseases. We then annotate the retained variants with predicted transcript consequences for a given set of transcripts specified in a Gene Transfer Format file. The 100KGP Rareservoir uses Ensembl v.104 canonical transcripts with a protein-coding biotype, of which &gt;90% are MANE (Matched Annotation from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> transcripts. The &#x2018;rsvr seqfx&#x2019; program determines a set of SO terms for each interacting transcript&#x2013;variant pair and encodes them as a CSQ ID, which is added to the CONSEQUENCE table. This table can also hold Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> corresponding to a transcript&#x2013;variant pair. Note that, as LOFTEE scores on the Genomics England Research Environment correspond to Ensembl v.99 transcripts, we mapped Ensembl v.104 canonical transcripts to the most similar v.99 transcripts having an identical coding sequence in order to obtain the LOFTEE scores for the 100KGP Rareservoir, finding a match for &gt;98% of transcripts. The contents of the Gene Transfer Format file are also imported into the database to create tables of transcript features (FEATURE), transcripts (TX) and genes (GENE). Optionally, VARIANT, GENOTYPE and CONSEQUENCE may be filtered for RSVR IDs that have CSQ IDs meeting particular criteria: for instance, to retain only variants with protein-coding consequences. The SAMPLE table of metadata and genetic statistics for each sample represented in the input VCF(s) must then be added to the database, including mandatory columns containing the ID, sex, family and an indicator of inclusion in the maximal unrelated set of samples in the database. The VARIANT, GENOTYPE and CONSEQUENCE tables are indexed by RSVR ID to support fast lookups by genomic location. The SAMPLE table and GENOTYPE table are indexed by sample ID, allowing fast lookups by sample. The CONSEQUENCE, TX and GENE tables are indexed by transcript and gene ID, allowing fast lookups of variants based on gene/transcript-specific consequences. If sample phenotypes have been encoded using phenotypic terms (for example, International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD10) codes or HPO terms), terms from the relevant coding systems can be added to a generic PHENOTYPE table mapping code IDs to descriptions, and codes assigned to samples can be added to the SAMPLE_PHENOTYPE table. Disease labels may be added to the CASE_SET table. The majority of the compute time required for building the database is taken by reading the genotype data from the input VCFs, which may be executed in parallel over separate regions against a merged VCF or over single gVCFs. The rsvr tool, implemented in C++, executes rapidly, with &#x2018;rsvr seqfx&#x2019; capable of assigning CSQ IDs for all Ensembl v.104 canonical transcripts to all variants (over 685&#x2009;M) in gnomAD v.3.0 in under 40&#x2009;min on a single core. The 100KGP Rareservoir, which is stored in an SQLite database, returns complex gene-specific queries in under 1&#x2009;s. For example, (1) a table with 628 rows containing the moderate- and high-impact variants with a PMAF score &#x2265;1 in <italic>TTN</italic> along with the corresponding consequence predictions and CADD scores takes 0.57&#x2009;s; (2) a table with 1,498 rows containing, for each variant, the samples and genotypes for individuals who carry an alternate allele takes 0.61&#x2009;s; and (3) a classification for each of the 77,539 participants into proband with the Specific Disease &#x2018;Dilated cardiomyopathy&#x2019;, relative of such a proband, unrelated control, or relative of a control takes 0.65&#x2009;s. Specific details on implementation of the workflow, code for encoding data as SQL statements compatible with Rareservoir and the mapping between bits in the 64-bit CSQ ID and each SO term assigned by rsvr seqfx can be found in the rsvr software package (see the code availability). Software packages rsvr 1.0, bcftools 1.9 and perl 5 were used to build the 100KGP Rareservoir.</p>

The expression evaluates to integers that can be represented using 63 bits, setting the most significant bit to zero when encoding as 64-bit integers.

The proportion of variants in gnomAD 3.0 weighted by allele count that can be encoded losslessly is 99.3%, while 99.8% can be represented by a distinct RSVR ID. The full variant information corresponding to any encountered ambiguous RSVR ID may be stored in full in an additional table. Structural variants that can be represented by a position and length may also be encoded using distinct 64-bit RSVR IDs alongside SNVs and indels by setting the most significant bit to one and subsequently, encoding the type of structural variant using 2 bits (deletion 0, duplication 1, inversion 2, insertion 3), the chromosome using 5 bits (as done for SNVs and indels), and the start and length consecutively using 28 bits.</p>

        <title>Genetic association analysis of 100KGP data</title>
        <p id="Par25">We constructed a Rareservoir in the Genomics England Research Environment containing the PASSing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> variants in the merged VCF of 77,539 consented participants in the 100KGP Rare Diseases Programme. This Rareservoir only included variants with a PMAF&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0 according to GnomAD v.3.0, an internal MAF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002 and at least one predicted consequence on a canonical transcript in Ensembl v.104. Variants with a greater MAF are unlikely to be highly penetrant for diseases eligible for inclusion in the 100KGP and are likely to have, at most, small effects on risk, making them challenging to validate. Variants with a median genotype quality &lt;35 and SNVs with a CADD Phred score &lt;10 were also excluded from the analyses.</p>
        <p id="Par26">For each of the 269 rare disease classes (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), we applied the BeviMed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> association test to rare variants extracted from the Rareservoir database in each of the 19,663 canonical transcripts belonging to a gene with a &#x2018;protein_coding&#x2019; biotype. The analysis was carried out using R 3.6.2, making use of functionality from packages Matrix 1.2&#x2013;18, dplyr 0.8.5, bit64 0.9&#x2013;7, bit 1.1&#x2013;14, DBI 1.1.0, RSQLite 2.1.4 and BeviMed 5.7. The case set for a given disease class and gene was constructed by selecting one case from each pedigree containing at least one person affected with the disease class. For the purposes of the association analysis, participants were labeled &#x2018;explained&#x2019; by a given gene if they had variants in that gene classified as &#x2018;pathogenic_variant&#x2019; or &#x2018;likely_pathogenic_variant&#x2019; in the &#x2018;gmc_exit_questionnaire&#x2019; table in the Genomics England Research Environment. To boost power, we used this information to reassign cases that were explained by variants in a different gene to the control group.</p>
        <p id="Par27">Using BeviMed, we performed a Bayesian comparison of a baseline model of no association and each of six association models defined by an MOI and a class of etiological variant.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">No association (prior probability 0.99)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Dominant association with &#x2018;high&#x2019;-impact variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2 (that is, corresponding to a target MAF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01%; prior probability 0.002475)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Dominant association with &#x2018;moderate&#x2019;-impact variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2 (prior probability 0.002475)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Dominant association with &#x2018;5&#x2032; UTR&#x2019; variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;2 (prior probability 0.00005)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Recessive association with &#x2018;high&#x2019;-impact variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 (that is, corresponding to a target MAF&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.1%; prior probability 0.002475)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Recessive association with &#x2018;moderate&#x2019;-impact variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 (prior probability 0.002475)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Recessive association with 5&#x2032; UTR variants having a PMAF&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 (prior probability 0.00005)</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par35">Thus, the overall prior probability of association was 0.01, and there was an equal prior probability of dominant and recessive inheritance. The PPA was the sum of the posterior probabilities of models 2&#x2013;7. We imposed a stricter PMAF threshold under a dominant MOI than under a recessive MOI because ceteris paribus, dominant variants are under stronger negative selection than recessive variants. The three groups of variants were selected as follows.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par36">5&#x2032; UTR variants: those with a 5_prime_UTR_variant consequence</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par37">High-impact variants: those with any consequence amongst start_lost, stop_lost, frameshift_variant, stop_gained, splice_donor_variant or splice_acceptor_variant, excluding variants with a &#x2018;low-confidence&#x2019; LOFTEE score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par38">Moderate-impact variants: those with any consequence amongst start_lost, stop_lost, frameshift_variant, stop_gained, splice_donor_variant or splice_acceptor_variant, missense_variant or inframe_deletion</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par39">The rationale for embedding variants from the high-impact class in the moderate-impact class is that both types of variant are capable of inducing a loss of function. The prior on the probability that a modeled rare variant is pathogenic, conditional on either the association model mediated by 5&#x2032; UTR variants or the association model mediated by moderate-impact variants, was set to Beta(2,8). This encodes a prior conditional expectation that 20% of rare variants are pathogenic, which is well suited to missense and 5&#x2032; UTR variants. However, we specified a distribution with a greater mean for the high-impact models. Specifically, the prior on the probability that a modeled high-impact variant is pathogenic was set to Beta(3,1), which reflects a prior conditional expectation that 75% of rare variants are pathogenic because loss-of-function variants tend to be functionally equivalent to each other. BeviMed reports the posterior probability that each variant is pathogenic conditional on the MOI and the class of etiological variant. The methodology is described in further detail in the original BeviMed publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par40">We applied the following postprocessing of BeviMed results with a PPA&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.95.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par41">We reran BeviMed including all samples (that is, with relatives of cases and controls).

Associations for which this removal caused the PPA to drop below 0.25 were filtered out because they depended on variants that were not shared by affected cases within families.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">To guard against false positives due to incorrect pedigree data, population structure or cryptic relatedness, we applied the following algorithm. We obtained the distribution of the number of rare variants in the Rareservoir shared by pairs of individuals within each assigned ancestry in the 100KGP. The top percentile in each of these distributions was used to indicate potential relatedness between participants in the same population. We reran BeviMed after removing cases so as to ensure that no more than one case from any set of potentially related cases sharing a variant was included in the analysis. Associations for which this analysis caused the PPA to fall below 0.25 were filtered out.</p></list-item></list></p>
        <p id="Par44">To account for correlation between case sets, for each gene, we removed all but the most strongly associated disease class within each disease group before reporting the 260 associations remaining. Without the postprocessing, the number of reported associations would have been 302. Conditional on the modal model underlying each of the 260 associations, we recorded the variants with a posterior probability of pathogenicity &gt;0.8 accounting for at least one case in the 100KGP.</p>

Given an association between a gene and a case set (corresponding either to a Specific Disease or to a Disease Sub Group), we searched for panels that contained the gene and had the same name as the case set (ignoring case). If such a match was not found, we searched for panels that contained the gene and that belonged to a Disease Sub Group with the same name as the Disease Sub Group of the case set. When this matching rule generated multiple matches, we selected the panel(s) with the highest evidence. If multiple panels still remained, we selected the panel with the smallest number of genes. Associations for which no matching panel in PanelApp could be found were inspected manually to assess whether PanelApp contained an alternative suitable panel (marked with an asterisk in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>
