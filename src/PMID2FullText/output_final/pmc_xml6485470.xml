        <p id="P3">Lymphocyte functions triggered by antigen recognition and cosignals imply rapid and intense cell division, hence metabolism adaptation<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The cytidine nucleotide triphosphate (CTP) is a precursor required for the metabolism of DNA, RNA and phospholipids<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. CTP originates from two sources: a salvage pathway and a <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway that depends on two enzymes, the CTP synthase (or synthetase) 1 and 2 (CTPS1 and CTPS2), although their respective roles are not known<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. CTP synthase activity is a potentially important step for DNA synthesis in lymphocytes<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Here, we report the identification of a loss of function homozygous mutation (rs145092287) in <italic>CTPS1</italic> in humans causing a novel and life threatening immunodeficiency characterized by an impaired capacity of activated T and B cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated activation. In contrast, proximal and distal TCR signaling events and responses were only weakly affected by the absence of CTPS1. Activated CTPS1-deficient cells exhibited decreased levels of CTP. Normal T-cell proliferation was restored in CTPS1-deficient cells by expressing wild-type <italic>CTPS1</italic> or by addition of exogenous CTP or its nucleoside precursor, cytidine. CTPS1 expression was found to be low in resting T cells, but rapidly upregulated following TCR activation. These results highlight a key and specific role of CTPS1 in the immune system by its capacity to sustain the proliferation of activated lymphocytes during the immune response. CTPS1 may therefore represent a therapeutic target of immunosuppressive drugs that could specifically dampen lymphocyte activation.</p>

    <p id="P4">We initially studied two unrelated families (family 1 and 2) originating from the northwest region of England, whose four children suffered from severe and recurrent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, in whom known primary immunodeficiencies have been excluded<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Four additional patients (family 3 to 5) originating from the same geographical area were identified thereafter (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). All patients had early onset of severe chronic viral infections, mostly caused by herpes viruses, including EBV and Varicella Zooster Virus (VZV) and, also suffered from recurrent encapsulated bacterial infections, a spectrum of infections typical of a combined deficiency of adaptive immunity (CID)<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and data not shown). Overall, the clinical phenotype is severe with 3 patients have died. Six of 8 patients have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Of note, none of the patients had extra-hematopoietic manifestations (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P5">Immunological investigations showed that most of patients had variable lymphopenia which was exacerbated during infection episodes with inversed CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio, while other blood cell counts were usually normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Extended Data Table 1</xref> and data not shown). Their immunoglobulin levels were normal or elevated with increased IgG but low IgG2 levels with low antibody titers to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Further analyses were performed in patient P1.2 showing naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell lymphopenia, increased numbers of effector memory T cells, low numbers of memory CD27<sup>+</sup> B cells, a complete absence of both invariant T cell populations (CD3<sup>+</sup>V&#x3B1;24<sup>+</sup>V&#x3B2;11<sup>+</sup>) iNKT and (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD161<sup>high</sup>V&#x3B1;7.2<sup>+</sup>) MAIT cells, as well as an impaired PHA- and antigen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Extended Data Table 2</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P6">To identify the gene defect underlying the immunodeficiency in these patients, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in three patients (P1.1, P1.2 and P2.1). Intersection of the genetic variations found in the three patients pointed to an unique common homozygous G to C mutation in the <italic>CTPS1</italic> gene encoding the CTP synthase 1 at position 41475832 in chromosome 1 with an assigned rsID (rs145092287) in the dbSNP database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Data Fig. 1a,b</xref>). <italic>CTPS1</italic> encodes a 67-kDa protein containing a CTP synthetase domain and a glutamine amide transfer domain promoting the formation of CTP from UTP and glutamine<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The identified mutation affects a splice donor site at the junction of intron 17-18 and exon 18 (IVS18-1 G&gt;C) leading to the expression of an abnormal transcript lacking exon 18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Data Fig. 1b,c</xref>). This splice mutation was found to be deleterious since CTPS1 protein expression could not be detected in lysates of EBV-transformed B cells and T-cell blasts from patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). In contrast, CTPS2 was expressed normally in patient cell lysates. In the five affected families, all patients were homozygous for the IVS18-1 G&gt;C mutation and all parents and tested healthy siblings were heterozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and data not shown). Sequencing of a cohort of 752 healthy individuals from the northwest of England gave an estimated frequency of homozygosity of 1:560,000. This represents more than a 10-fold increase compared to the frequency estimated from available exome databases. WES data and analysis of polymorphic microsatellite markers in all patients revealed a common region of homozygosity of 1.1 Mb surrounding the IVS18-1 G&gt;C mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information</xref>). All these data were indicative of a founder effect. These observations led us to conclude that the immunodeficiency resulting from the <italic>CTPS1</italic> mutation in these patients could be primarly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency.</p>
    <p id="P7">We next examined CTPS1 expression in normal tissues. CTPS1 mRNA expression was comparable between the different tissues, except for T cells in which CTPS1 expression was strongly up regulated after cell activation in response to TCR-CD3 and CD28 co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Interestingly, in lysates from T-cell blasts and T cells from PBMCs, CTPS1 protein was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). In contrast, CTPS2 expression was readily detected. Activation of T cells by anti-CD3 antibody or phorbol 12-myristate 13-actate (PMA) and ionomycin stimulations induced CTPS1 protein expression while activation with IL-2 and/or IL-15 resulted in only weak effect. Under the same experimental conditions, CTPS2 expression was also induced but to a lesser extent. In TCR-CD3-stimulated T-cell blasts, CTPS1 protein expression was enhanced from 12 hours and persisted for up to 96 hours as a consequence of <italic>CTPS1</italic> gene transcription activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1d</xref>, inset and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). As expected, no expression of CTPS1 was detected in T-cell blasts from the CTPS1-deficient patient (P1.2) contrasting with detection of CTPS1 mRNA and suggesting protein instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). These data indicate that T-cell activation through the TCR results in a rapid and sustained CTPS1 protein expression. Of note, in B cells activated by anti-BCR and CpG, IL-4 and CD40L or PMA and ionomycin, CTPS1 was also found to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P8">To further characterize the consequences of the CTPS1 deficiency in T cells, we investigated proximal T-cell activation signals as well as late responses. CTPS1-deficient T cells exhibited normal early and late responses with the exception of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and CD25 and CD69 upregulation which were found to be decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Basal and activation-induced cell death was also slightly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Extended Data Fig. 4g</xref>). These data suggest that CTPS1 deficiency had limited consequences in signaling downstream of TCR-CD3. Because the pool of CTP is potentially a limiting factor for DNA synthesis<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, we carefully analyzed proliferation of CTPS1-deficient T-cells. In response to activation by antigens, anti-CD3 antibody or co-stimulation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, CTPS1-deficient cells from three patients (P1.1, P1.2 and P2.2) failed to sustain proliferative responses as measured by <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake and CFSE or violet cell tracer dye dilution (resulting in a weak index of cell proliferation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Extended Data Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">6</xref>). Uptakes of <sup>3</sup>H-Uridine and <sup>3</sup>H-Cytidine were also found to be impaired in activated CTPS1-deficient T cells. This suggests that both RNA and DNA synthesis were affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Defective proliferation of CTPS1-deficient T cells was associated with a lack of cell cycle progression since a majority of cells were arrested in the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Proliferation of CTPS1-deficient B cells activated by anti-BCR and CpG was also found to be defective whereas that of IL-2-activated NK cells seemed to be less affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P9">Down-regulation of CTPS1 expression in control T cells, by lentiviral transduction of two distinct shRNA together with a GFP reporter gene, led to a specific decrease in the CD3-mediated proliferation of GFP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). No changes in proliferation were detected in non-targeted GFP-negative cells or in cells targeted with a scramble shRNA. The diminished proliferation resulting from the inhibition of CTPS1 expression led to a selective cell growth disadvantage with a decreased number of GFP targeted cells over time (middle panel). A similar decrease in proliferation rate was also observed in the Jurkat T-cell line in which CTPS1 expression was down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P10">Together, these results indicate that CTPS1 deficiency causes a defect in T-cell proliferation in response to TCR-CD3 activation. To formally prove the causal relationship between CTPS1 deficiency and defective T-cell proliferation, we carried out reconstitution experiments with wild-type <italic>CTPS1</italic> or by direct addition of CTP or its cytidine precursor that acts on CTP levels via the salvage pathway. Expression of ectopic CTPS1 in CTPS1-deficient T-cells fully restored proliferation upon CD3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>) and enabled cells to expand selectively as shown by the accumulation of GFP-positive cells expressing CTPS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, left panels). No such effect was detected in CTPS1-deficient cells transduced with an empty vector or in control cells transduced with the CTPS1-containing vector.</p>
    <p id="P11">Proliferation and CD25 expression of CTPS1-deficient cells also recovered to a normal level by addition of CTP or cytidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and data not shown). In contrast, addition of a mix of UTP, GTP and ATP or uracil, guanine and adenosine did not result in increased proliferation of CTPS1-deficient cells. To determine the influence of the CTPS1 defect on the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis pathway, we measured the incorporation of carbon from <sup>14</sup>C-aspartate into nucleic acids of activated CTPS1-deficient T cells, which is a specific assay for <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Extended Data Fig. 6 b,c</xref>). Incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and <sup>3</sup>H-uridine was analyzed in parallel as control of the global RNA and DNA synthesis. TCR-CD3 activation-mediated incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C-aspartate, <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and <sup>3</sup>H-uridine was significantly decreased in CTPS1-deficient T cells. Addition of exogenous CTP or cytidine that bypassed the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathway restored incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine but not of <sup>14</sup>C-aspartate in CTPS1-deficient cells, thus demonstrating that the <italic>de novo</italic> CTP synthesis pathway is impaired in the absence of CTPS1. Deazauridine, an analogue of UTP and a known inhibitor of CTP synthetase activity<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> completely blocked T-cell proliferation of control cells in response to CD3 activation without affecting proximal TCR-CD3-mediated responses, similar to results observed in CTPS1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref> and data not shown). As expected, inhibition of T-cell proliferation by deazauridine was fully reverted by addition of CTP and partially by UTP, but not by ATP or GTP. Analysis of nucleotides pools in activated CTPS1-deficient T-cell blasts and CTPS1-deficient B/EBV cell lines revealed decreased levels of CTP, as also observed in activated normal cells treated with deazauridine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). Defective CTPS1 expression or addition of deazauridine also led to reduced pools of ATP, GTP and UTP in activated T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>) suggesting interconnection in the nucleotide pools<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, CTP as well as ATP, GTP and UTP were found to be normal or increased in resting CTPS1-deficient T cells as the salvage pathway is predominent in quiescent cells<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Expression of wild-type CTPS1 in CTPS1-deficient B/EBV cell lines restored levels of CTP comparable to control cells and confered to cells a selective cell growth advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h,i</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P12">This study reveals a critical role for CTPS1 in promoting the proliferation of T cells following their activation. However, proliferation of B cells was also found to be dependent of CTPS1. This may directly participate to the susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections seen in CTPS1-deficient patients and account for the low titers of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> antibodies as it is a T-independent B-cell response. The role of CTPS1 in B cells coud be different or/and less important than in T cells. Of note, CTPS1-deficient B cells preserve an intact capacity to expand upon transformation by EBV and patients had normal Ig levels and/or elevated IgG. Decreased expansion of NK cells and low numbers of iNKT and MAIT cells might also contribute to the CTPS1 immunodeficiency as these cells have been proposed to play a role in a broad range of immune responses including anti-EBV immunity<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. The finding that CTPS1-deficiency causes no other significant clinical consequences favors a redundancy with CTPS2 activity in other cell lineages and tissues. Interestingly, pyrimidine pools including CTP have been previously shown to be strongly expanded in PHA-stimulated T cells via de novo pathways including increased CTPS activity<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The induction of CTPS1 expression in activated T cells reported here thus appears as the major determinant of CTP pool increase. Indeed, proliferation of CTPS1-deficient T cells was restored to normal level by addition of CTP. The exact mechanism(s) by which TCR signaling induces a rapid expression and activation of CTPS1 in T cells remains to be determined, although we showed that the ERK pathway is required as well as tyrosine phosphorylation signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Extended data Fig. 3c</xref>). It is interesting to note that T cell differentiation does not appear to be severely impaired by CTPS1 deficiency, suggesting that CTP pools in thymocytes may originate from the nucleoside salvage pathway and/or the CTPS2 activity<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Notably though, CTPS1 activity is critical for the intense cell division induced by antigenic stimulation as exemplified by massive proliferation and expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during viral infections<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
    <p id="P13">In the absence of CTPS1, we showed that <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis pathway is impaired but not totally abrogated. This residual activity is likely dependent of CTPS2. Recently, the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis pathway was shown to be dependent on post-transcriptional regulation by mTORC1 and S6 protein (S6K) kinases that activate the first enzymatic steps required for pyrimidine synthesis<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Thus, distinct regulatory mechanisms control <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis. Based on the present study, CTPS1-mediated tuning of CTP synthesis in lymphocytes appears to be a key element in enabling adaptive immune responses. If CTPS1-specific inhibitors can be designed, they would potentially be highly specific immunosuppressive drugs able to inhibit auto- or allogenic-specific T and B cell responses without additional toxicity given the lymphocyte specificity of the CTPS1-deficiency phenotype. In conclusion, our results provide the first <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of a role of the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis pathway as a critical step for proliferation of T and B lymphocytes when activated by antigens.</p>

The cDNAs were verified by sequencing and inserted into a bicistronic lentiviral expression vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter (pLenti7.3/V5-TOPO, Invitrogen). Viral particles for infection were obtained by coexpression of the lentiviral vector containing CTPS1 with third-generation lentiviral plasmids containing Gag-Pol, Rev and the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) into HEK 293T using calcium phosphate. Viral supernatants were collected every 12 h on 2 consecutive days, starting 48 h after transfection, and viral particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 49,000 g for 1.5 h at 12&#xB0;C. Cells were infected with viral particles at a minimal titer of 10<sup>7</sup> TU ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup> and 48 h after infection, cells were deprived of IL-2 during 72 h for proliferation assays. To assess the selective advantage of GFP expression during long-term expansion, blasts were re-stimulated with antiCD3/CD28 beads (Invitrogen) every 48 h during 8 days. For CTPS1 gene knockdown, blasts or Jurkat cells were infected at day 3 of PHA stimulation with the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector containing a CTPS1-specific shRNA (Openbiosystems, n&#xB0;TRCN0000045349 and n&#xB0;TRCN0000045350) or a scrambled shRNA in which the puromycin resistance gene was replaced by the GFP gene. Proliferation was analyzed in GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>&#x2212;</sup> blasts after 4 days of stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads as previously described. For survey of loss of GFP expression in long-term expansions, blasts were repeatedly stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads every 48 h during 8 days.

After 12,000 g centrifugation for 5 min at 4&#xB0;C, supernatants were transferred to a 384-wells plate and kept at 4&#xB0;C in auto sampler before injection. Aliquots of 5 &#x3BC;L were injected onto a separation column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH300 C18, 1.7 &#x3BC;m, 2.1&#xD7;100 mm reversed-phase column, Waters) with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and analyzed with a tandem mass spectrometry system consisting of an Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC Waters) interfaced with a xevo-TQ-S tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A programmed mobile phase-gradient was used during a 7-min run: 0 min, 1% B; 5 min, 10% B; 5.1 min, 100% B; 6 min, 100% B; 6.1 min, 1% B; 7 min, 1% B. The content of the 4 nucleotides ATP, GTP, UTP and CTP was quantified in the electrospray negative ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Transitions of m/z 505.9&gt;408 and 505.9&gt;272.9 were used for quantification and confirmation of ATP, respectively, and those of 521.9&gt;158.9 and 521.9&gt;177 for GTP, 482.8&gt;158.9 and 482.8&gt;79 for UTP, and 481.8&gt;158.9 and 481.8&gt;384 for CTP. Concentrations were determined by using calibration curves of the 4 nucleotides. The linearity, exactitude and variability were determined for the technical validation of this assay. The linearity gave a correlation coefficient of the linear regression curves greater than 0.99 for the 4 nucleotides. The minimum and maximum recovery of spiked samples with the 4 nucleotides at a concentration of 90 mg/L and 250 mg/L ranged from 72% to 123%.
