      <abstract>
        <p id="P2">Selenium binding protein1 (SELENBP1) has been associated with several
cancers. Its exact role was unknown. We show that SELENBP1 is a methanethiol
oxidase (MTO), related to MTO of methylotrophic bacteria, converting
methanethiol to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, formaldehyde and H<sub>2</sub>S, an
activity not known to exist in humans. Mutations in <italic>SELENBP1</italic>
were found in five patients with a cabbage-like smelling breath. Increased
levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide are the main odorous compounds in
their breath and responsible for the malodor. Increased urinary excretion of
dimethylsulfoxide is a diagnostic biomarker of MTO-deficiency. Patient
fibroblasts showed reduced amounts of SELENBP1 protein and deficient MTO
enzymatic activity which could be restored by lentiviral-mediated expression of
the wild-type <italic>SELENBP1</italic> gene. A knockout mouse line showed the
same biochemical characteristics. Our data define a novel inborn error of
metabolism caused by MTO-deficiency leading to a malodor syndrome. MTO
deficiency may be a frequent inborn error of metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="P3">Volatile sulfur-containing compounds hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S),
methanethiol (MT, CH<sub>3</sub>-SH) and dimethylsulfide (DMS,
CH<sub>3</sub>-S-CH<sub>3</sub>) have been identified as the main contributors
of halitosis or bad breath <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The origin of
halitosis can be intra- or extra-oral <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Intra-oral halitosis
is the most common form usually caused by MT and H<sub>2</sub>S produced by
Gram-negative bacteria located on the dorsum of the tongue or in gingival- and
periodontal crevices. Extra-oral halitosis has an estimated prevalence of 0.5-3% in
the general population <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Its origin is less
well understood. Extra-oral bad smelling breath can be caused by conditions
affecting the nose, sinuses, tonsils, and esophagus, but evidence indicates that in
some patients the extra-oral halitosis is blood-borne <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. In blood-borne halitosis malodorant compounds, most commonly DMS, are
carried to the lungs where they enter the breath <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Mouth and nose breath DMS concentrations of these patients showed a
five- to six-fold increase compared to controls <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. The cause for increased DMS levels in these patients is unknown. DMS
is produced from MT by methylation. Both compounds result from the complex
microbiome-mammalian co-metabolism of volatile sulfur compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Under physiological
conditions MT has three sources in the human body <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>: production from sulfur
containing amino acids by intestinal bacteria; formation within intestinal cells by
methylation of H<sub>2</sub>S by thiol S-methyltransferase; biosynthesis from
methionine by the transamination pathway in human endogenous metabolism. Under
pathological conditions, it has been found that increased levels of DMS can lead to
high concentrations of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylsulfone
(DMSO<sub>2</sub>) <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sub>.</sub> The
enzymes involved in these conversions are largely unknown and a contribution of the
gut bacteria is expected <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Interestingly cancer patients were found to
produce MT and DMS as prominent volatile organic compounds <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. DMS is produced
in significant amounts by lung- and liver cancer cell lines <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and was found in
lung tumor tissue<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.</p>
      <p id="P4">Recently, a methanethiol oxidase (MTO) was purified from the
<italic>Hyphomicrobium</italic> strain VS <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The gene encoding this
enzyme was identified and showed 26% homology at the protein level to the human
<italic>SELENBP1</italic> gene, encoding a protein possessing selenium binding
properties but with unknown function <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Reduced expression
of the human gene has been found in several tumors, and a tumor suppressor function
has been suggested <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. We hypothesized that mutations in
<italic>SELENBP1</italic> could be causative for extra-oral halitosis. We
studied five patients with extra-oral halitosis caused by elevated levels of DMS in
the blood. We identified SELENBP1 as the human MTO, catalyzing the conversion of MT
into formaldehyde, H<sub>2</sub>S and hydrogen peroxide
(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Mutations in <italic>SELENBP1</italic> cause
extra-oral halitosis and define a novel inborn error of metabolism.</p>

        <title>Extra-oral halitosis patients</title>
        <p id="P5">We studied five patients from three unrelated families with extra-oral
halitosis with a cabbage-like odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure
2A</xref>). The patients had high levels of DMS in their mouth- and nose
breath. Known causes, such as intake of DMS containing food, use of
sulfur-containing medication, lower gastrointestinal problems, known metabolic
defects such as methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency and tyrosinemia were
excluded. Family A is a German family of Turkish origin with two affected
children (AII-2 and AII-3), family B is Portuguese with one affected child
(BII-2), and family C is a Dutch family with two affected children (CII-1 and
CII-2). The unifying clinical feature was the pungent malodor from the breath.
Other clinical signs and symptoms of the patients differed considerably (for a
full description see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Note</xref>). The two patients in the Dutch family are from a
non-consanguineous marriage and the malodor was their only clinical symptom. The
mother of patients CII-1 and CII-2 had some complaints of halitosis. The parents
of the other patients were consanguineous. The female patient in family A had
malodor as only symptom while her brother had a broader spectrum of clinical
symptoms with neurological features. The Portuguese patient also had
neurological sequelae.</p>

        <title>Breath and body fluid analyses</title>
        <p id="P6">Breath and body fluid analyses used complementary methods (NMR
spectroscopy, gas-chromatography) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table
1</xref>). Because of the malodor body fluid NMR spectroscopy was requested
in the index patients of the three families. NMR showed the presence of
increased concentrations of DMSO and DMSO<sub>2</sub> in their body fluids
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2 B and C</xref>).</p>
        <p id="P7">Using gas-chromatography with a sulfur detector an increased
concentration of an additional sulfur-containing compound, DMS, was detected
(<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1B</xref>). Increased DMS
concentrations in blood have been described in patients with extra-oral
halitosis <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. DMSO<sub>2</sub> is an oxidation product of DMS. Increased
DMSO<sub>2</sub> concentrations have been observed in blood of patients with
methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. DMSO<sub>2</sub> also occurs in cerebrospinal fluid after
DMSO<sub>2</sub> intake as dietary supplement <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Additional investigations on breath samples of patients
AII-3 and CII-2 revealed increased levels of a fourth sulfur-containing
compound, MT. The MT concentration in breath of these patients was ten times
higher than the highest value in control persons and unaffected family members.
Specialized dental clinics may use portable gas chromatography to detect this
specific form of halitosis (see breath analysis of CII-2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).
We detected increased MT levels in urine in some of our patient samples. Because
MT is highly volatile and reactive, reproducible quantification of urinary MT
was impossible.</p>
        <p id="P8">Patient BII-2 was treated for five days with the antibiotic Metronidazol
(500 mg oral; three times/day). The concentration of DMS in breath decreased to

days of Metronidazol. After cessation, the DMS levels in breath and urine
returned to values before treatment. In patient AII-3 a methionine loading trial
was performed. Initial levels of 18 and 129 &#x3BC;mol/mmol creatinine for DMSO
and DMSO<sub>2</sub> rose to 67 and 178, respectively at 12 h after loading. At
20 h the levels were still increased (48 and 152). These data are in line with a

to the breath- and body fluid concentration of MT, DMS and its further oxidation

      <p id="P25"><italic>SELENBP1</italic> was first cloned by Chang <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> based on homology to the mouse selenium binding protein
(mSBP56) <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Binding of selenite by SELENBP1 was suggested to occur via
cysteine-57 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. The bacterial MTOs do not
have Cys at the 57-position nor in close proximity. Therefore Selenium binding seems
not essential for MTO enzyme activity of SELENBP1. Selenite binding was found
essential for a specific interaction of SELENBP1 with the von Hippel-Lindau
protein-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. SELENBP1 was not known to possess enzymatic activity <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. In incubations of control human fibroblasts
and erythrocytes with the MTO-substrate MT we observed a rapid conversion of MT in
time and were able to measure stoichiometric amounts of the H<sub>2</sub>S formed.
The enzymatic activity was strictly dependent on the presence of oxygen. We based
the presumed reaction formula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) on our
results and on the homologous <italic>Hyphomicrobium</italic> strain VS enzyme for
which also H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and formaldehyde were confirmed as reaction
products. The apparent K<sub>m</sub> value of the human MTO towards MT, 4.8 nM, is
very low. According to the BRENDA database there are only very few enzymes with such
a low K<sub>m</sub> value. The formation of DMS from MT is normally of minor
importance (an estimated 1% of MT is converted into DMS in control individuals <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The high flux through the MTO reaction
becomes apparent in our patients and in the KO mouse model. In the deficiency state
an alternative metabolic pathway comes in place resulting in substantial amounts of
DMS, DMSO and DMSO<sub>2</sub> in the body fluids of the affected individuals. This
underpins the relevance of the MTO enzyme reaction in human metabolism.</p>
      <p id="P26">Deficiency of MTO activity may have metabolic consequences. These can be
toxicity effects due to accumulating sulfur compounds. Data on toxicity of MT, DMS
and DMSO are anecdotal and only little is known about low-dose toxicity of these
compounds (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, and TOXNET). No cell
biological effects of an increased MT concentration have been documented. The MTO
enzymatic activity of the SELENBP1 protein sheds new light on this because at least
two of the products of this enzyme, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>S,
are biologically active molecules possessing cellular signaling functions. Decreased
availability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>S may have metabolic
consequences. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is important because of its role in
cellular signaling <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>S is a
gaseous signaling molecule, a gasotransmitter, like nitric oxide and carbon monoxide
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. At low concentrations it acts as
mitochondrial electron donor thus stimulating electron transport in mammalian cells
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The general effect of H<sub>2</sub>S is
cyto-protective <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and H<sub>2</sub>S therapy
for several disorders aims at vasodilatation, antioxidant upregulation, inflammation
inhibition, and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. At high
concentrations H<sub>2</sub>S is toxic by its known inhibition of the respiratory
chain complex IV. In view of these literature data we cannot exclude that toxic
effects of accumulating sulfur compounds or the lack of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
or the gasotransmitter H<sub>2</sub>S may be causing other clinical signs and
symptoms in patients with <italic>SELENBP1</italic> mutations than malodour only.
The low apparent K<sub>m</sub> of MTO may be important to avoid MT toxicity but also
may have a role in the gasotransmitter producing system that operates at the
nanomolar level. Three enzymes in human metabolism are known to produce
H<sub>2</sub>S. These are cystathionine <italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-synthase
(CBS), cystathionine <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>-lyase (CSE or CGL) and
3-mercapto-pyruvate sulfur transferase (3MST) <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Our data show that the MTO encoded by <italic>SELENBP1</italic> is a
fourth human H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme. The degree to which SELENBP1
contributes to the total H<sub>2</sub>S production is so far unknown.</p>
      <p id="P27">One may speculate that the function of SELENBP1 may lie in keeping the
breath MT concentration low enabling the human nose to detect foul smell from
environmental volatile sulfur compounds. The human nose is very sensitive for MT and
DMS which have a very high odor index <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The
sensitivity towards sulfur-containing compounds is evolutionary beneficial since
these compounds often represent &#x2018;danger&#x2019; in the form of decaying food
sources. The low apparent K<sub>m</sub> of MTO is essential to keep the MT
concentration in the body below the odor threshold level.</p>
      <p id="P28">The presence of MTO activity in erythrocytes seems rather surprising since
red blood cells have only few functions other than transporting oxygen. The presence
of SELENBP1 protein as one of the major non-heme proteins in these cells has been
described before in the naked mole rat <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and
in humans <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Also one of the other known H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzymes, 3MST,
has been found in erythrocytes. Local H<sub>2</sub>S production in the bloodstream
may be important for vasodilatation <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. A second H<sub>2</sub>S producing enzyme in
the red blood cell underpins the importance of this metabolite for this cell or the
role that the erythrocyte plays in the delivery of H<sub>2</sub>S as cargo. It
remains to be established which of these two enzymes has the most important
contribution to H<sub>2</sub>S formation in the blood. We have no indications for
vascular problems in patients with MTO mutations but this is open for further
investigations.</p>
      <p id="P29">SELENBP1 is a possible biomarker for disease progression in several cancers,

diffusion of sulfur-containing gases from the tumour in an animal model caused a
significant decrease in tumour proliferation rate <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. The mechanism of SELENBP1 tumor suppression is largely unknown <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The SELENBP1 interaction with the von
Hippel-Lindau protein-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1, which is involved in
cancer suppression may play a role <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Also
its interaction with GPX1 (glutathione peroxidase 1), interestingly also a
selenocysteine-containing protein, may be relevant <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Both proteins are present in erythrocytes. GPX1 is a potent
antioxidant enzyme involved in counteracting oxidative stress by reducing peroxide
to water to limit its destructive effects <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>.
Several cancers have been described to have reduced GPX1 expression (reviewed by
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Besides a tight physical
interaction, SELENBP1 and GPX1 have complex regulatory effects on each other <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>. Our finding that SELENBP1 is in fact a
human MTO that produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is enzymatically converted
by GPX1, may shed new light on the interactions between SELENBP1 and GPX1.
Deregulation of either enzyme may cause a misbalance in local
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
concentration must be controlled because of its bivalent roles in both oxidative
damage as well as in cellular signaling <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>.
The function of SELENBP1 in sulfur metabolism sheds new light on the tumor
suppression mechanism and the role of the local concentrations of MT, DMS and
H<sub>2</sub>S in this process. It is well known that dogs can smell the
presence of some tumors in patients <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. With
our data it is tempting to speculate that MT and DMS are the compounds that the dogs
will smell in patients with cancer.</p>
      <p id="P30">Taken together the putative tumor suppression role of SELENBP1 and the
presence of DMS in tumors nicely fit together against the background of the
enzymatic function of SELENBP1 as the long sought methanethiol oxidase.</p>
      <p id="P31">In conclusion, our experiments have identified a novel human enzyme
activity, a methanethiol oxidase. The enzyme is encoded by
<italic>SELENBP1</italic>. <italic>SELENBP1</italic> mutations cause extra-oral

in the patients. Theoretically this syndrome may be a treatable inborn error of
metabolism when using dietary measures. SELENBP1 has been studied as a biomarker for
several cancers. The finding that SELENBP1 has an enzymatic role in sulfur
metabolism and influences the concentration of biologically active molecules as
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S may provide new clues and targets

        <p id="P37">Analysis of MT for comparison of fibroblast MTO activity was done with a
Chrompack CP9001 GC that was equipped with a sulfur-specific flame photometric
detector (FPD) and a two meter glass column (four mm ID) packed with Carbopack B
HT, as described <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. In addition an
Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Middelburg, The Netherlands) was used, of which
the FPD detector had a lower detection limit (0.05 pmol). This allowed us to
study the MT kinetics of MTO in the low nM range. This GC had the same column of
Carbopak B HT100 fitted to the capillary inlet of the FPD detector (set at 200
&#xB0;C). The empty part of the inlet side of the column was extended into the
heated GC inlet (150 &#xB0;C) up to the septum to avoid any contact of sample
gas with metal parts, since MT and other volatile sulfur-containing compound are
notorious for their stickiness to metals. For both GC's the carrier gas
was nitrogen (80 ml/min). For MTO enzyme activity measurements where both
hydrogen sulfide and MT were measured the column was set at 100 &#xB0;C. For
higher sensitivity desired in MTO kinetics when sulfide was trapped, the
temperature was set at 130 &#xB0;C. For MT and DMS analysis in breath the
initial column temperature was set at 100 &#xB0;C and after 0.5 min. increased
to 140 &#xB0;C resulting in retention times of 0.6 min. for H<sub>2</sub>S,
1.4 min. for MT and 6 min. for DMS, respectively.</p>

        <title>Analysis of MT and DMS in breath</title>
        <p id="P38">Breath samples were collected in three Liter Tedlar bags (SKC, Procare
BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) via a tube (ID 4 mm). The end of this tube was
pierced through a 12 mm rubber stopper. This stopper was pressed against one
nostril while the other one was kept closed. The bag was filled in 2-4 goes
after a relative deep breath through the nose was taken. Each go took 5-10
seconds. For DMS analysis three ml subsamples were taken from the bag and
injected into the GC (lower limit of detection: 1 ppb). For MT analysis 400 ml
subsamples were concentrated on a Tenax tube (13 cm, 3 mm ID) that was kept in
dry ice (10 min. precooling). About 1.5 cm of the Tenax tube was sticking out
above the dry ice pellets and insulated by polystyrene, to prevent MT absorbing
at the very beginning of the Tenax. The breath subsamples were pushed manually
over the Tenax tube with a 100 ml glass syringe (with a Teflon plunger tip) at a
rate of 5 ml/sec. To trap water from the breath samples a tube (8 cm, 4 mm ID)
filled with CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O was fitted in between the syringe
and the Tenax tube. The end of the Tenax tube was extended with a 40 cm empty
part that was coiled and sticking out of the dry ice. This acted as a gas
reservoir for nitrogen gas that was passed over the Tenax after the samples (15
s at 200 ml/min). To desorb the trapped MT a three ml plastic syringe (Braun
Injekt, fully polypropylene/ polyethylene, so no rubber plunger tip) was
connected to the inlet of the Tenax tube which was subsequently taken out of the
dry ice and quickly submerged completely in a hot water bath (95 &#xB0;C).
After 20 s in the water bath the three ml syringe was filled quickly in this way
passing the hot nitrogen from the gas reservoir over the Tenax. The full content
of the three ml syringe was now injected into the Agilent 7890B gas
chromatograph (see above). The MT recovery of the Tenax trapping/desorbing
method described here was about 60%. Calibration of MT for this method was done
by injecting increasing amounts from a MT stock into a 15 L Tedlar bag that was
filled with 10 L of clean air. The lower limit of detection for MT for this
method was five ppt (parts per trillion). Loss of MT in Tedlar bags at room
temperature was estimated at 10-25% after one day and verified for each bag
used. Analysis was performed within 8 h (patient CII-2, loss &lt; 10%) and
24 h (patient AII-3, loss &lt;10%), respectively. The Tenax trapping part of
the method was similar to that described previously by Tangerman <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> who used liquid nitrogen for cooling.
The method suffers from some inherent inaccuracies and difficulties. MT absorbs
to the Teflon parts of the 100 ml glass syringe. The same syringe is used
throughout and cleaning in between samples that can differ a factor of 30 in MT
concentration is critical. The same is true for the Tedlar bags used for
collecting breath samples. The variation in gas flow rate from the syringe when
concentrating MT on the Tenax tube may cause differences in the Tenax zone (both
width and position) that is loaded with MT and will influence the desorption
behavior. Also the position of the Tenax tube in the dry ice pellets during
loading and in the hot water bath for desorption of the Tenax tube has limited
reproducibility, as has the gas flow rate during manual desorption of MT by the
three ml syringe. Reproducibility of duplicate samples from the same bag was in
general good with differences less than 20%. Only for the low ppt values close
to detection level differences could be higher, up to 50%.</p>

        <title>MTO enzyme assay</title>
        <p id="P49">MTO enzymatic activity was measured by incubating cell homogenates or
plasma in closed bottles and measuring the disappearance of added MT via
headspace GC analysis. The use of new glassware proved essential for obtaining
low and reproducible background measurements. To compare MTO activity in
fibroblast- and colon cell lines, we used three ml Exetainer vials (Labco
Limited). Cell homogenates (400-700 &#x3BC;l, equivalent to 0.75 - 1.85 mg of
protein) were transferred in the vials and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (0.2 mM final
concentration) was added to trap H<sub>2</sub>S produced by MTO. This
concentration was found not to inhibit the MTO enzymatic activity. After closing
the bottles 12-25 &#x3BC;l of a freshly prepared MT stock solution (0.82 mM)
was added by syringe, resulting in a MT concentration in the liquid phase of
12-23 &#x3BC;M. Vials were horizontally shaken at 200 rpm and 35 &#xBA;C. For
MT analysis 100 &#x3BC;l gas samples were taken by syringe and determined by GC
analysis. Because of the reactivity of MT, mainly oxidation into
dimethyldisulfide, we always detected low levels of MT disappearance in control
bottles without added enzyme. These rates were subtracted from experimental
rates. For MTO activity measurements in erythrocytes and mouse tissue extracts
the standard assay was performed in 250 ml screw cap serum bottles (neck size 28
mm ID). This allowed bigger gas samples to be taken for GC analysis with less
effects of changing the gas volume and septum leakage. Also background MT
disappearance was much lower. Bottles with 25 ml of PBS containing
ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (0.2 mM) and BSA (0.3mg/ml) were closed with red rubber
septa and incubated at 350 rpm at 35 &#xBA;C. Four nmoles of MT were added,
resulting in about 50 nM in the liquid phase. For the determination of the
reaction stoichiometry and the oxygen dependency higher MT concentrations were
used (20 - 75 nmoles, giving 250-950 nM MT in the liquid). After preincubation
with MT for 15 - 20 min. the MTO reaction was started by the addition of
erythrocytes or tissue extracts which were diluted in 1 ml PBS. Gas samples (1
ml) were taken every 1.5 - 4 min. for GC analysis. The lower limit of detection
for MTO activity in erythrocytes was 0.01 nmol.&#x3BC;l
<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>, in fibroblasts 0.5 nmol.mg
protein<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup> and in mouse tissue extracts 1 nmol.mg
protein<sup>-1</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>. To study the kinetics of MTO in
erythrocytes and colon cells the assay was scaled up to 500 ml serum bottles
with 50 ml PBS. The amount of MTO added was adjusted in a way to obtain a
reliable MT consumption rate over a period of about 10 -20 min.</p>
        <p id="P50">At the end of the incubations with fibroblasts Zn-trapped H<sub>2</sub>S
was released by the addition HCl to a final concentration of 0.1M using a
syringe and shaking the bottles for ten min. at 25 &#xBA;C to reach gas-liquid
equilibration for H<sub>2</sub>S. The resulting H<sub>2</sub>S concentration was
determined in the headspace by GC analysis. Total H<sub>2</sub>S was calculated
by assuming a gas/liquid concentration ratio for H<sub>2</sub>S of 1 : 2.47
which was calculated from reported solubility data <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>. Addition of Zn traps the H<sub>2</sub>S that otherwise
builds up in time and inhibits the MTO enzyme reaction.</p>
        <p id="P51">The gas/liquid ratio for the concentration of MT in PBS at 35 &#xBA;C
was determined at 1: 5.5. This was calculated from the amount of MT that
dissolved in the liquid after addition of a fixed amount of MT to a closed 50 ml
bottle that contained 10 ml of PBS. The dissolved amount was determined by
comparing the headspace MT concentration of the gas phase in this bottle with
the gas phase MT concentration in an empty bottle (so without PBS) that received
the same amount of MT. A slightly different ratio of 1:5 was obtained when using
PBS in 250 ml bottles to which also BSA (0.3 mg.ml<sup>-1</sup>) was added. For
sulfide a gas/liquid ratio of 1: 12.5 was obtained in such bottles. After
acidification a value of 1: 5.5 was found and this is much lower than expected
at 35 &#xBA;C (1:2) <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>. We attributed
the higher amount of sulfide dissolved to the presence of BSA for which
adsorption of sulfide has been suggested <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>.</p>

intermittent shaking. At 70 &#xB0;C most of the DMS from the sample is in the
gas phase. 2.6 ml of gas phase was transferred into a 3 ml syringe and analyzed
by GC. From water samples with DMS, &gt;80% was recovered in this way. The
