Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is essential for cell growth and organ development; however, the role of YAP1 in AT2 cells during pulmonary fibrosis is still unclear. YAP1 expression was found to be downregulated in the AT2 cells of PF patients. Deletion of YAP1 in AT2 cells resulted in lung injury, exacerbated extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and worsened lung function. In contrast, overexpression of YAP1 in AT2 cells promoted alveolar regeneration, mitigated pulmonary fibrosis, and improved lung function. In addition, overexpression of YAP1 alleviated bleomycin (BLM) -induced senescence of alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, YAP1 promoted the expression of peroxiredoxin 3 (Prdx3) by directly interacting with TEAD1. Forced expression of Prdx3 inhibited senescence and improved mitochondrial dysfunction in BLM-treated MLE-12 cells, whereas depletion of Prdx3 partially abrogated the protective effect of YAP1. Furthermore, overexpression of Prdx3 facilitated self-repair of the injured lung and reduced ECM deposition, while silencing Prdx3 attenuated the antifibrotic effect of YAP1. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that YAP1 alleviates lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis by regulating Prdx3 expression to improve mitochondrial dysfunction and block senescence in AT2 cells, revealing a potential novel therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Alveolar YAP1: Key to lung regeneration and fibrosis prevention</title><p id="Par2">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is still not fully understood, and effective treatments are scarce.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease characterized by scar formation in the lung parenchyma that causes loss of respiratory function and a consequent decrease in longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Efforts are still being made to better understand the pathogenesis of IPF in the search for treatments for pulmonary fibrosis. Lung alveolar epithelial injury is a leading cause of multiple pulmonary diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Under physiological conditions, alveolar type II (AT2) cells in injured lungs activate self-repair programs and promote their own proliferation and differentiation into alveolar type I (AT1) cells to maintain alveolar epithelial homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, persistent insults to the lungs lead to senescence of AT2 cells and maladaptive lung repair, ultimately resulting in pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. It has been reported that the senolytic drug combination of dasatinib and quercetin inhibited senescence in the alveolar epithelium, thus attenuating experimental pulmonary fibrosis in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This indicates that blocking the senescence of AT2 cells might be a therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Cellular senescence, defined as permanent arrest of the cell cycle, can be triggered by multiple stress stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Senescent cells exhibit an enlarged and flattened morphology and increased expression of &#x3B2;-galactosidase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although senescent cells remain in the stationary phase of the cell cycle, they still express various cytokines through the activation of a program known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial dysfunction might be both a cause and a result of senescence and plays a critical role in inducing and sustaining the senescence phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The features of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as a reduced respiratory capacity, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), contribute to cellular senescence. Recent research has revealed that melatonin treatment inhibits premature senescence in A549 cells by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">The Hippo signaling pathway was originally identified in research on tumor suppressor genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. YAP1 is a vital downstream effector of Hippo signaling that plays a critical role in modulating organ size, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Due to the lack of DNA-binding domains, YAP1 exerts its effects by interacting with DNA-binding proteins, among which TEAD1 is the most frequent interacting partner. It has been reported that the YAP1/TEAD1 complex mediates mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis by directly targeting PGC1&#x3B1;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, in osteoarthritis, YAP1 functions as a senescence inhibitor by upregulating the expression of FOXD1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that YAP1 may inhibit cellular senescence by improving mitochondrial function.</p>
      <p id="Par6">In this study, YAP1 expression was found to be increased in the lung fibroblasts of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and in BLM-treated mice, which was in line with our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, we found downregulation of YAP1 in AT2 cells in the lungs of IPF patients. Overexpression of YAP1 prevented lung senescence, restored lung structure, and inhibited pulmonary fibrosis. More importantly, we revealed that YAP1/TEAD1 improved mitochondrial function by transcriptionally activating peroxiredoxin 3 (Prdx3), thereby suppressing the senescence of AT2 cells. Overall, we propose the role of the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis in regulating AT2 cell senescence and pulmonary fibrosis, revealing a novel strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.</p>

A set of single-cell data from IPF patients (GSE135893) was obtained, and analysis of this dataset revealed significantly decreased expression of YAP1 in AT1 and AT2 cells from IPF patients compared with those from control donors, while the expression of YAP1 was significantly increased in lung fibroblasts, in accordance with our previous finding that the upregulation of YAP1 in lung fibroblasts promoted pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>).

The knockout efficiency of YAP1 was validated using western blot and immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). The results indicated that YAP1 expression was significantly lower in YAP1-cKO mice than in WT mice, which confirmed the successful knockout of YAP1 in AT2 cells.

        <title>Role of YAP1 in BLM-induced lung injury and senescence</title>
        <p id="Par31">It is well known that the senescence and apoptosis of AT2 cells disrupt lung homeostasis, ultimately leading to pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that YAP1 prevents pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the senescence of AT2 cells and promoting the regeneration of pulmonary alveoli. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, compared to that in WT mice, the number of Aqp5/Sftpc-labeled AT1/AT2 cells decreased markedly in YAP1-cKO mice after BLM administration. Moreover, TUNEL assays showed that knockout of YAP1 in AT2 cells promoted apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Moreover, HE staining revealed exacerbated damage to the lung structure and inflammatory infiltration in YAP1-cKO mice treated with BLM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Western blotting revealed greater p21 expression in YAP1-cKO mice than in WT mice after BLM treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Accordingly, YAP1-cKO mice treated with BLM exhibited dramatically elevated expression of SASP factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). IHC staining revealed increased expression levels of senescence-associated proteins, including p16 and p21, in YAP1-cKO mice treated with BLM; similarly, senescence-associated &#x3B2;-galactosidase activity was greater in YAP1-cKO mice than in WT mice treated with BLM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Function of YAP1 in BLM-induced lung injury and senescence.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative images showing Sftpc (red), Aqp5 (green), and nuclei (blue) in frozen lung sections from WT and YAP1-cKO mice.

        <p id="Par32">In contrast, the overexpression of YAP1 in AT2 cells facilitated the regeneration of lung alveoli and inhibited AT2 cell apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>).

        <title>YAP1 transcriptionally activates Prdx3 by interacting with TEAD1</title>
        <p id="Par33">As a transcriptional coactivator, YAP1 may perform its function by entering the nucleus and binding to the transcription factor TEAD1 to regulate the expression of downstream genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we further explored the underlying mechanism by which YAP1 inhibits senescence. ChIP-seq and proteomic analyses showed that YAP1 modulated mitochondrial organization and the response to oxidative stress-related signaling <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Then, we integrated the ChIP-seq and proteomics data, and 31 overlapping genes were found. Then, we found that peroxiredoxin-3 (Prdx3), a mitochondrial antioxidant, exhibited a strong regulatory relationship with YAP1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, d</xref>). Western blot and qRT&#x2012;PCR analyses demonstrated that overexpression of YAP1 increased the protein and mRNA expression of Prdx3, whereas silencing of YAP1 exerted the opposite effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e, f</xref>). A ChIP assay was used to validate the regulatory effect of YAP1/TEAD1 on the Prdx3 promoter, and the results showed that the presence of YAP1/TEAD1 significantly increased the relative abundance of ChIP products, substantiating the modulatory relationship of the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). Furthermore, the binding site of YAP1/TEAD1 in the Prdx3 promoter was determined using a luciferase assay: 9 binding sites in the Prdx3 promoter were predicted by JASPAR, and the Prdx3 promoter was subsequently divided into 4 parts. YAP1/TEAD1 had a much weaker regulatory effect on Prdx3-4 than on Prdx3-1, Prdx3-2, or Prdx3-3, which means that the sites at which YAP1/TEAD binds to the promoter of Prdx3 are in the region between positions -1202 and -531 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). More importantly, blockade of the YAP1/TEAD1 interaction by verteporfin treatment or the YAP1<sup>S94A</sup> mutation decreased the ability of YAP1 to upregulate Prdx3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>YAP1/TEAD1 directly targets Prdx3.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Proteomic analysis showing that signaling pathways were modulated by YAP1. <bold>b</bold> ChIP sequencing analysis results demonstrating the signaling pathways regulated by TEAD1. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Heatmap showing the expression of overlapping significantly altered genes identified by integrating the proteomics and ChIP sequencing data. <bold>e</bold>, <bold>f</bold> Western blot and qRT&#x2012;PCR analyses of the expression of Prdx3 in MLE-12 cells transfected with the YAP1 plasmid or si-YAP1, <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3. <bold>g</bold> ChIP assay showing the relative ChIP product abundances in MLE-12 cells transfected with the YAP1 or TEAD1 plasmid; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3. <bold>h</bold> Relative luciferase activity was measured in MLE-12 cells transfected with various fragments of the Prdx3 promoter; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3. <bold>i</bold> Western blot showing the expression levels of Prdx3 in YAP1-overexpressing MLE-12 cells treated with verteporfin or expressing YAP1<sup>S94A</sup>; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;3.

        <title>Prdx3 is necessary for the protective effect of YAP1 against senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
        <p id="Par34">Since mitochondrial dysfunction is a precipitating factor for cellular senescence, we explored the effect of Prdx3 on mitochondrial function and senescence in MLE-12 cells after BLM induction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">b</xref>, Prdx3 significantly inhibited BLM-induced cellular senescence by downregulating the expression of p16 and p21 and decreasing the activity of SA-&#x3B2;-gal. Moreover, Prdx3 overexpression markedly suppressed MLE-12 cell apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>). The formation of &#x3B3;H<sub>2</sub>AX foci, a hallmark of DNA damage and senescence, was also inhibited in MLE-12 cells overexpressing Prdx3 after BLM induction (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1d</xref>). BLM treatment dramatically increased the expression of Drp1 and inhibited the expression of Mfn2, whereas these effects were reversed by transfection of the Prdx3 overexpression vector (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1e</xref>). ROS measurement demonstrated reduced levels of cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS in MLE-12 cells transfected with the Prdx3 overexpression vector, indicating that elevated expression of Prdx3 could reduce intracellular ROS accumulation (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1f</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of Prdx3 restored the mitochondrial membrane potential and maintained mitochondrial length and morphology (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1g, h</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of Prdx3 increased oxygen consumption in BLM-treated MLE-12 cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1i</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that Prdx3 plays a protective role by inhibiting BLM-induced cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>
        <p id="Par35">Then, we explored whether YAP1 exerts its protective effect by regulating Prdx3. Western blotting showed that Prdx3 silencing partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of YAP1 on senescence and that overexpression of YAP1 significantly downregulated the expression of senescence-associated markers such as p16 and p21, an effect that was abolished by si-Prdx3 transfection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). SA-&#x3B2;-gal activity was elevated in YAP1-overexpressing cells transfected with si-Prdx3; moreover, the decrease in the cell size caused by YAP1 overexpression was abolished after silencing of Prdx3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). In addition, knockdown of Prdx3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of YAP1 on the expression of Bax and Cyt-C, indicating that YAP1 modulates apoptosis through Prdx3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Immunofluorescence assays revealed that YAP1 overexpression decreased the fluorescence intensity of &#x3B3;H<sub>2</sub>AX and that this decrease was abolished by si-Prdx3, suggesting the antisenescence function of the YAP1-Prdx3 axis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Similarly, forced expression of YAP1 increased the expression of Mfn2 and downregulated the expression of Drp1 after BLM treatment in MLE-12 cells, and these effects were reversed by transfection with si-Prdx3, indicating that YAP1 maintains the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion by modulating Prdx3 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Accordingly, Prdx3 silencing in the background of YAP1 overexpression increased the production of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). Additionally, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was dramatically reduced in Prdx3-depleted cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Moreover, Prdx3 silencing abrogated the effect of YAP1 on mitochondrial length and morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>). The Seahorse assays indicated that YAP1 restored the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate, whereas this effect was abolished by si-Prdx3 transfection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6i</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicated that YAP1 inhibited cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction by elevating the expression of Prdx3.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Silencing of Prdx3 abolishes the effects of YAP1 on senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Western blot analysis of p16 and p21 expression; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6. <bold>b</bold> SA-&#x3B2;-gal staining to evaluate senescence in MLE-12 cells transfected with the YAP1 overexpression plasmid or si-Prdx3 after BLM treatment; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6.

        <title>Forced expression of Prdx3 suppresses pulmonary fibrosis in mice</title>
        <p id="Par36">We next investigated whether the overexpression of Prdx3 prevents pulmonary fibrosis in mice. To this end, we treated WT mice with AAV5-Prdx3 14 days before BLM administration to increase Prdx3 expression in AT2 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Overexpression of Prdx3 restored the lung respiratory capacity and attenuated lung structural remodeling in BLM-treated mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b, c</xref>). Moreover, forced expression of Prdx3 inhibited the BLM-induced upregulation of fibrosis-associated proteins and genes such as Fn1 and &#x3B1;-SMA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d, e</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Prdx3 decreased collagen deposition, &#x3B1;-SMA synthesis and the hydroxyproline content in the lungs of BLM-treated mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f&#x2013;h</xref>). In addition, HE staining demonstrated that AAV5-Prdx3 administration inhibited inflammatory infiltration in BLM-treated mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7i</xref>). Moreover, Prdx3 reduced the activity of senescence-associated &#x3B2;-gal and decreased the expression of p21 in mice after BLM induction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7j, k</xref>). TEM revealed that Prdx3 overexpression ameliorated the loss of mitochondrial cristae loss and mitochondrial swelling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7l</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of Prdx3 improved mitochondrial function by altering the expression levels of Drp1 and Mfn2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7m</xref>).

        <title>Knockdown of Prdx3 facilitates pulmonary fibrosis in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice</title>
        <p id="Par37">Next, we assessed the role of YAP1 and Prdx3 silencing in cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Pulmonary function tests and micro-CT analysis demonstrated that Prdx3 silencing increased pulmonary fibrosis in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice, indicating that YAP1 inhibited BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis through Prdx3 in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>). Western blot and qRT&#x2012;PCR analyses revealed significantly upregulated expression of fibrosis-related proteins and genes such as Fn1 and &#x3B1;-SMA in Prdx3-depleted YAP1-cKI mice following BLM administration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d, e</xref>). Furthermore, Prdx3 knockdown resulted in collagen deposition and lung structural remodeling in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f&#x2013;i</xref>). In addition, Prdx3 knockdown increased SA-&#x3B2;-gal activity in YAP1-cKI mice following BLM treatment, suggesting that Prdx3 silencing promoted cellular senescence in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8j, k</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8l</xref>, the YAP1-cKI mice exhibited reductions in mitochondrial swelling and the loss of mitochondrial cristae induced by BLM, and this protective effect was abolished by the administration of AAV5-sh-Prdx3. The balance of mitochondrial fission and fusion was disrupted in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice after Prdx3 depletion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8m</xref>). Taken together, these findings from our animal experiments suggested that overexpression of YAP1 in AT2 cells exerted antifibrotic effects by regulating Prdx3.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Silencing of Prdx3 promotes pulmonary fibrosis in BLM-treated YAP1-cKI mice.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of the experimental design showing the silencing of Prdx3 in YAP1-cKI mice treated with BLM. <bold>b</bold> Pulmonary function parameters, including Cst and IC, were measured in YAP1-cKI mice treated with AAV5-sh-Prdx3 or AAV5-sh-NC; <italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4. <bold>c</bold> Micro-CT images of the axial plane (upper panels) and corresponding coronal plane (middle panels) in YAP1-cKI mice treated with AAV5-sh-Prdx3 or AAV5-sh-NC.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par38">IPF is a chronic disease that is strongly correlated with age and has limited therapeutic options. Injury to the alveolar epithelium leads to the senescence and death of AT2 cells, resulting in the activation of an inflammatory response and repair program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, aberrant communication between endothelial cells, inflammatory cells and epithelial cells and fibroblasts promotes sustained fibroblast activation and ECM deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, we described the decreased expression of YAP1 in IPF patients and fibrotic mouse lungs. Our study showed that mice deficient in YAP1 in AT2 cells exhibited deterioration of lung respiratory function and exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis following BLM administration. We further found that after BLM challenge, YAP1-cKI mice exhibited an improved pulmonary respiratory capacity and attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis. The effect of YAP1 on AT2 cells during pulmonary fibrosis depended on the modulation of cellular senescence and mitochondrial function mediated through targeting of Prdx3. We also identified the beneficial role of Prdx3 in vivo. Overexpression of Prdx3 suppressed experimental pulmonary fibrosis, whereas silencing Prdx3 partially abrogated the protective effect of YAP1. Hence, we elucidated that targeting the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis may be an effective therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8n</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par39">YAP1 is a transcriptional coactivator regulated by the canonical Hippo signaling pathway. When Hippo signaling is unactivated, YAP1 translocates into the nucleus to bind to its partners, such as TEAD1, to activate downstream genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that YAP1 plays critical roles in tumorigenesis, inflammation, and organ fibrosis. Forced expression of the active form of YAP1 in mature mouse hearts was reported to promote cardiac repair and improve contractility following myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In contrast, loss of YAP1/TAZ inhibits cardiac fibroblast activation to suppress unfavorable cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These results indicate that altered expression of YAP1 in different types of cells may lead to different disease outcomes. Regarding the effect of YAP1 on pulmonary fibrosis, research has shown that the inhibition of YAP/TAZ through dopamine receptor D1 in lung fibroblasts reduces pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par40">However, a previous study revealed aberrant activation of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway in AT2 cells of IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and Alexander et al. showed that increased expression of YAP in epithelial progenitor cells of the embryonic lung resulted in pulmonary lesions, a characteristic shared with IPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; these findings were contradictory to our results. However, it has been reported that increased expression of YAP1 in AT2 cells after lung injury could promote lung regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Moreover, a study revealed that endothelial cell-derived S1P caused the nuclear translocation of YAP1 in AT2 cells and subsequently facilitated lung repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The reason for these contradictory findings may be because in different stages of IPF development, the Hippo/YAP pathway is activated to promote lung repair after insult. Another possible reason may be limitations inherent in the BLM-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis: although the administration of a single dose of bleomycin directly into the lungs of mice is a commonly utilized experimental model for investigating pulmonary fibrogenesis, this model still exhibits significant differences from IPF in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. One limitation is that the predominant inflammatory phase occurs 3&#x2013;7 days after BLM treatment and is characterized by the upregulation of acute inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and spontaneous reversal of fibrosis then occurs 3&#x2013;4 weeks post-intratracheal bleomycin administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Hence, further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of YAP1 in AT2 cells through which BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis was inhibited in our study.</p>
      <p id="Par41">Cellular senescence is a consequence of replicative limitations or other precipitating factors, such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. A previous study demonstrated a senescent phenotype of AT2 cells in IPF patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Senescent AT2 cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines through the activation of a program termed the SASP to activate lung fibroblasts. A recent report revealed that the suppression of AT2 cell senescence alleviated pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting that inducing senescence in AT2 cells may be an effective therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. YAP1 is a potent factor that inhibits senescence and promotes cell survival. It has been reported that YAP1 functions as a negative regulator of p21 to eliminate senescent cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, we demonstrated decreased expression of p16 and p21 in the lungs of YAP1-cKI mice treated with BLM. Moreover, overexpression of YAP1 suppressed BLM-induced senescence in MLE-12 cells. This result was in accordance with a previous study showing that YAP1 restrained astrocyte senescence by targeting the expression of CDK6 in the context of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, researchers have shown that hyperactivation of YAP1 in primary human ovarian surface epithelial cells induces cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and this finding seems to contradict our results. Therefore, further research should be carried out to explore the complicated underlying mechanism involved.</p>
      <p id="Par42">Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common precipitating factor for most chronic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction is a main cause of senescence, and mitochondrial aberrations, such as the loss of cristae and destruction of the inner membrane, are often observed in senescent cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Increasing evidence has revealed that damage to mitochondria may cause senescent cell cycle arrest, and mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to premature senescence in T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Hence, restoring mitochondrial function may inhibit cellular senescence.</p>
      <p id="Par43">Peroxiredoxins are the most abundant superfamily of peroxidases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Prdx3, an important peroxiredoxin located mainly in mitochondria, can eliminate superoxide radical anions and hydrogen peroxide, which are generally collectively referred to as ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. It is well known that mitochondria are the dominant source of ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>&#x2014;in the physiological state, ROS function as important cellular signaling molecules; however, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupts the redox balance and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. A recent report demonstrated the protective effect of Prdx3 on mitochondrial dysfunction during cerebellar ataxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Prdx3 is a crucial downstream target of APN/SIRT3 signaling that inhibits mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we found that Prdx3 maintained the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion, restored the mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ROS production, which eventually suppressed BLM-induced senescence in AT2 cells. Silencing of Prdx3 abolished the beneficial effects of YAP1, indicating the vital role of the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis in inhibiting cellular senescence and maintaining cell survival, whereas overexpression of Prdx3 in AT2 cells alleviated pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, our study revealed that the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis inhibits lung senescence, promotes cell survival and lung repair, and alleviates pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
      <p id="Par44">In this study, we first revealed that increased expression of YAP1 in AT2 cells mitigated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and revealed the regulatory relationship between YAP1/TEAD1 and Prdx3. Moreover, our study revealed that the YAP1/TEAD1-Prdx3 axis acts as a novel antifibrotic mediator by inhibiting the senescence of AT2 cells and maintaining alveolar epithelial homeostasis, consistent with recent studies showing that YAP1 is critical for AT2 cell regeneration during lung inflammation and injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, approaches for elevating the expression of YAP1 are limited because of the lack of agonists of YAP1. Hence, AAV-mediated gene therapy may become a novel strategy for delivering YAP1. Recent studies have demonstrated the application of AAV-DTR/DT to establish an acute lung injury model, and an AAV carrying proSFTPB cDNA was shown to significantly restore surfactant homeostasis, inhibit lung injury and improve pulmonary function in SFTPB-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In this study, we utilized AAV5 to increase the expression of Prdx3, but the curative effect of AAV-mediated YAP1 transfer needs further validation in clinical trials.</p>
      <p id="Par45">Overall, our research demonstrated that YAP1 attenuated the chronic injury-induced senescence of AT2 cells and inhibited pulmonary fibrosis. This effect was exerted by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress through targeting of Prdx3.</p>
