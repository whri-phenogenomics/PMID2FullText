      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="p0030">The centrosome, the primary microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in eukaryotic cells, is composed of a pair of centrioles (termed mother- and daughter-centrioles) that are surrounded by an electron-dense matrix known as pericentriolar material (PCM). In proliferating cells, the formation of centrioles/centrosomes is strictly regulated by the cell cycle, where the centrioles undergo semi-conservative duplication to ensure cell entry in mitosis, involving two functional centrosomes and a bipolar spindle that arranges chromosomes on the metaphase plate.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Moreover, the centrosome has a major function in primary ciliogenesis. In non-proliferating cells, the mother centriole migrates to the cell surface to form a basal body, which serves as the template for the formation of cilia.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Therefore, structural and/or functional defects in centrosomes/centrioles are closely associated with abnormal cell division and cell cycle progression, chromosomal aneuploidy, and ciliary dysfunction.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
      <p id="p0035">The centrosome protein (CEP) family is the active component of the centrosome and is essential for centriole biogenesis. Though hundreds of candidate genes that may encode centrosome-related proteins have been included in the centrosome database (centrosomeDB),<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> as well as in the Cell Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/cell/centrosome" id="intref0010">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/cell/centrosome</ext-link>), only about 30 related genes have been well characterized and classified as members of the CEP family thus far.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> CEPs are involved in various developmental stages of the centriole and centrosome. For example, CEP135 plays an important role in centriole elongation,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> while CEP152 is involved in initiating centriole duplication.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Pathogenic variants in CEPs are associated with syndromes that present with microcephaly and neurodevelopmental defects, suggesting that CEPs have a particularly critical role in brain development.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Implicated genes include the autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH)-related genes <italic>CENPJ</italic> (MCPH6, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="608393" id="intref0015">608393</ext-link>), <italic>CEP135</italic> (MCPH8, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="614673" id="intref0020">614673</ext-link>), <italic>CEP152</italic> (MCPH9, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="614852" id="intref0025">614852</ext-link>), and <italic>CEP215</italic> (MCPH3, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="604804" id="intref0030">604804</ext-link>) and the microcephalic primordial dwarfism (Seckel syndrome)-related gene <italic>CEP63</italic> (SCKL6, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omim.org/entry/614728" id="intref0035">614728</ext-link>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omim.org/" id="intref0040">https://omim.org/</ext-link>). Notably, there is a known overlap in the etiology of MCPH and Seckel syndrome, e.g., bi-allelic variants in <italic>CENPJ</italic> and <italic>CEP152</italic> also result in Seckel syndrome (SCKL4, MIM:<ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="613676" id="intref0045">613676</ext-link> and SCKL5, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="613823" id="intref0050">613823</ext-link>, respectively). In addition, defects in CEPs can lead to classical ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome (JBTS) associated with <italic>CEP41</italic> (JBTS 15, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="614464" id="intref0055">614464</ext-link>), nephronophthisis (NPHP) associated with <italic>CEP164</italic> (NPHP 15, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="614845" id="intref0060">614845</ext-link>), and Meckel syndrome (MKS, also known as Meckel-Gruber syndrome) associated with <italic>CEP290</italic> (MKS4, MIM: <ext-link ext-link-type="omim" xlink:href="611134" id="intref0065">611134</ext-link>). Most CEP genes, however, remain unlinked to specific Mendelian genetic diseases in humans.</p>
      <p id="p0040">In this study, we identified bi-allelic variants of <italic>CEP295</italic> in four paediatric individuals from two unrelated families showing highly consistent clinical phenotypes, characterized as Seckel-like syndrome with primary microcephaly and short stature. We uncovered defects in centriole biogenesis, centrosome formation, and ciliary biogenesis in patient-derived fibroblasts. Our findings strongly suggest that <italic>CEP295</italic> is a causative gene of Seckel-like syndrome. We further report a foetus with typical features of MKS, including encephalocele and dysplastic kidney, who was assumed to harbour bi-allelic variants of <italic>CEP295</italic> because both the parents were heterozygotes of <italic>CEP295</italic>.</p>

In contrast, the patient's fibroblasts had a 3-fold reduction in ciliary formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#xA0;4</xref>a and b).

This study included four individuals with compound heterozygous variants of <italic>CEP295</italic>. They shared common clinical features, including severe microcephaly, short stature, GDD/ID, pachygyria and simplified gyria, and craniofacial and digital abnormalities. Notably, phenotypic analysis of other CEPs showed the features of patients with mutant <italic>CEP295</italic> largely overlapped with those of <italic>CENPJ</italic>- and <italic>CEP152</italic>-associated Seckel syndrome.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> CEP295 can directly interact with CEP152, forming a conserved architectural network essential for centriole-to-centrosome conversion during mitosis in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> We, therefore, propose terming the phenotype of these four patients as Seckel-like syndrome.</p>
      <p id="p0185">Loss of centrioles in the neural stem cells is thought to be a cause of primary microcephaly, as the spindle positioning is disturbed, leading to a decrease in the pool of neural precursors.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Defects in centrosomes/centrioles trigger p53-dependent apoptosis, which ultimately contributes to the development of primary microcephaly. In mice, depletion of p53 could rescue cell death and the reduced brain size phenotype.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Mechanistically, centrosome loss causes cell arrest at the G<sub>1</sub> phase, which leads to the activation of p53/p21 mediated by USP28 and 53BP1.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Consistently, after inducing centrosome/centriole defects in the patient-derived fibroblasts, we observed proliferation inhibition and elevated p53/p21 levels in patient's fibroblasts and also in CEP295-depleted U2OS cells. In addition, defects in primary cilia are known to impair various steps of cerebral cortical formation, including progenitor development and neuronal migration, differentiation, and connectivity.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Consequently, structural and functional neurological deficits have been widely observed in ciliopathies, such as JBTS and MKS.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Similar deficits can also be observed in microcephaly and are associated with some centrosome proteins. For example, CENPJ is essential for cilium disassembly and neurogenesis in the mouse cortex, which is independent of its role in centrosome biogenesis.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Here, we showed that CEP295 depletion leads to cilium loss and the formation of shorter cilia in human cells. Additionally, complementary experiments using synthesized CEP295 mRNA showed that the WT CEP295, rather than the P562L mutant, can fully restore the centrosome/centriole and ciliary developmental defects in patient-derived fibroblasts. Though the evidence is limited, we here suggest that the neurodevelopmental delay of the four patients presented in this study may be attributed to the primary microcephaly caused by a combination of defects in centrosome/centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p0190">MKS is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy characterized by occipital encephalocele, cystic-dysplastic kidneys, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and polydactyly.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Here, we report a stillbirth who was clinically diagnosed with MKS, showing a distinct phenotype from the other four patients. The foetus was presumed to harbour a homozygous deleterious variant of <italic>CEP295</italic> (p. Q868Rfs&#x2217;25) inherited from his consanguineous parents. As MKS is a lethal ciliopathy,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> patient 5 did not survive, and no biological samples were available to further elucidate ciliary development. Though our findings indicate that <italic>CEP295</italic> variants may be associated with ciliopathy, we cannot exclude the possibility of a <italic>de novo</italic> variant elsewhere in the genome of the foetus. Thus, investigating whether CEP295 deficiency can cause these two distinct phenotypes is necessary in the future. Given that conventional depletion of CEP295 leads to prenatal lethality in mice and zebrafish models (data not shown), constructing conditional knock-in animal models with the point mutations identified from the patients with microcephaly and MKS is the most feasible strategy.</p>
      <p id="p0195">In summary, we have shown bi-allelic loss of functional variants of <italic>CEP295</italic> in patients with primary microcephaly, which we defined as Seckel-like syndrome. This study extends our understanding of the role of CEPs in the pathogenesis of primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome. Additionally, we demonstrated that the loss of function of CEP295 results in defects in cilium formation and suggested the possible correlation between CEP295 variants and the MKS phenotype.</p>
