      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dystonia makes up &#x2248;20% of all movement disorders and can be classified according to aetiology, localization, age of onset and accompanying symptoms. Neurodegenerative and structural lesions must be investigated first with cranial imaging for aetiological diagnosis after clinical diagnosis [<xref rid="rkae083-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dystonia 30 has recently been included in the idiopathic isolated dystonia classification. Dystonia 30 is an autosomal dominant genetic disease causing dystonic symptoms in individuals in the first decade of life, affecting the autophagy&#x2013;endolysosomal system, and is caused by heterozygous and homozygous variations in the vacuolar protein sorting 16 (<italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic>) gene [<xref rid="rkae083-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
      <p>FMF is a monogenic, autoinflammatory syndromic disease characterized by recurrent fever and abdominal pain associated with <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> variations. The diagnosis can be made by clinically recurrent abdominal or chest pain, arthritis and the presence of at least 1&#x2013;3&#x2009;days of these symptoms and at least two of these criteria, and a single clinical episode is sufficient for the diagnosis in case of confirmed genetic anomaly [<xref rid="rkae083-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The genetic aetiology of FMF is complex, as epigenetic factors and interactions with other genes occur [<xref rid="rkae083-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It was reported that neurological disorders are also detected as well as the symptoms of FMF in patients with <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> variations, but dystonia is not among these symptoms [<xref rid="rkae083-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a large-scale review [<xref rid="rkae083-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], genes with risk factors for dystonia were identified, but <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> was not included in this list. In addition, when all <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> gene variations described in the literature were examined, it was found that the comorbidity of dystonia and diabetes mellitus (DM) was not reported.</p>
      <p>In this article, we discuss a male index case who was diagnosed with generalized dystonia, DM and FMF as well as his family phenotype and genotype relationship.</p>

        <title>Genetic analysis method</title>
        <p>DNA samples of the patient and parents were isolated from peripheral blood. Next-generation sequencing technology was used to determine the sequence of all genes using the whole exome sequencing (WES) technique. All replicated FASTQ files and bioinformatics analyses were processed using (Qiagen QCI Analyse Universal 1.5.0, Hilden, Germany). Secondary analyses were performed using QCI Analyze Universal 1.5.0 (Qiagen) and tertiary analyses and interpretations were made using Clinical Insight Interpret (Qiagen). The variants was confirmed by the Sanger sequence analysis method and the results were analysed using the Variation Surveyor program (Philadelphia, USA).</p>

        <title>Patient 1 (index case)</title>
        <p>Patient 1 was a 17-year-old male diagnosed with <underline>g</underline>eneralized dystonia prominent in the cervical region at 10&#x2009;years of age and type 1 DM at 14&#x2009;years of age. FMF was diagnosed by the Rheumatology Unit. Examinations included cranial MRI, laboratory examinations of metabolic diseases, echocardiography, thoracic and abdominal CT, electromyography (EMG) and cognitive tests. All results were found to be normal.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing included <italic toggle="yes">DYT-1</italic> gene variation analysis, which was normal. Exon scanning was performed with WES and <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> c.1513C&gt;T/ Arg505* heterozygous class II (possibly pathogenic for dystonia), <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> c.2080A&gt;G p.Met694val heterozygous class I (pathogenic for FMF) and <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> c.1772T&gt;C p.Ile591Thr (with an unknown meaning for FMF) heterozygous class III variations were detected.</p>
        <p>For dystonia, the patient was started on levodopa, and when there was no response, an appropriate dose of trihexyphenidyl was initiated. When the response was not sufficient, repetitive botulinum toxin injections were administered. He had fever and acute abdominal pain at the age of 11&#x2009;years and an appendectomy was performed. Insulin therapy was started for type 1 DM. Colchicine was added to the treatment for FMF.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Patient 2</title>
        <p>Patient 2 was a 14-year-old female (sister of index case) diagnosed with type 1 DM at 12&#x2009;years of age and writer&#x2019;s cramp at 14&#x2009;years of age. Examinations included cranial MRI, abdomen and thorax CT, EMG, echocardiography and cognitive tests. All results were normal.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing showed the same variations on WES as in the index case.</p>
        <p>Botulinum toxin injections were administered for writer&#x2019;s cramp. She also takes insulin therapy for type 1 DM.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Patient 3</title>
        <p>Patient 3 was a 55-year-old male (father of index case) with type 1 DM, but no symptoms related to FMF or movement disorder. His haemoglobin A1c was 7.5%.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing showed heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> c.1513C&gt;T/ Arg505* and <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> c.2080A&gt;G p.Met694val variations.</p>
        <p>He did not use the recommended oral antidiabetic and did not go for follow-ups.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Patient 4</title>
        <p>Patient 4 was a 44-year-old female (mother of index case) diagnosed with hypothyroidism. No symptoms related to FMF or movement disorder were in her history and no DM. Laboratory examinations did not reveal any findings suggestive of inflammation or diabetes.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing showed a heterozygous MEFV c.1772T&gt;C Ile591Thr variation.</p>
        <p>She had been on levothyroxine for a long time to treat hypothyroidism.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This article describes a Turkish family with different phenotypes associated with two genetic variations not previously described together. The father had <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> PPV (Possible Pathogenic Variation) and <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> c.2080A&gt;G p.Met694val PV (Pathogenic Variation) but only had diabetes, while the siblings had additional <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> c.1772T&gt;C p.Ile591Thr VUS (Variation of Unknown Significance) for FMF along with dystonia and type 1 DM. The mother, with only the <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> VUS, did not have dystonia, FMF or diabetes. These differences suggest a potential interaction of genetic variations in dystonia, diabetes and FMF.</p>
      <p>The <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> gene is located on chromosome 20, which encodes the VPS16 protein. The VPS16 protein is involved in cellular processes such as autophagosome maturation, endosomal transport, endosomal vesicular fusion, endosome-to-lysosome transport, intracellular protein transport, regulation of SNARE complex assembly and non-autophagic vacuolar fusion [<xref rid="rkae083-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cai <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="rkae083-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] described a disease with autosomal recessive dystonia caused by homozygous variations in the <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> c.156 C&gt; gene in five individuals with adolescent-onset primary dystonia secondary to this variation in 2016, then named &#x2018;dystonia 30&#x2019;. Steel <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="rkae083-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] described the clinical and demographic characteristics of 19 patients who were diagnosed with dystonia 30. In clinical terms, patients have abnormal dystonic contractions. These contractions can be generalized and progress slowly. Besides dystonia, psychiatric symptoms were also reported in these patients and the frequency of autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetration of <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> was found to be higher. In cell lines obtained from patients, microscopic vacuolar changes resulted in lysosomal dysfunction and abnormalities in autophagosome&#x2013;lysosome fusion after the pathologies in endosomal&#x2013;lysosomal fusion [<xref rid="rkae083-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The genetic variations in this study involve different regions in the <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> gene PPV; however, the <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic> gene c.1513C&gt;T/p.Arg505* detected in the family presented was not reported. Although the father in the family had a PPV of <italic toggle="yes">VPS16</italic>, the absence of dystonia could be explained by incomplete penetrance or the absence of <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> VUS. Further studies are needed to determine these possibilities. However, although no diabetes-related gene variation was detected in the family, the father and his two children were diagnosed with diabetes. Moreover, the children were diagnosed with diabetes 10&#x2009;years earlier than the father&#x2019;s age at diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> gene encodes the pyrin, located on chromosome 16 and causes FMF disease in its pathologies [<xref rid="rkae083-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="rkae083-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This protein acts as an associative protein, ensuring the binding of the main proteins needed for the formation of the inflammasome complex, inhibiting autophagosome and lysosome assembly in its deficiency [<xref rid="rkae083-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="rkae083-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. FMF clinical diagnosis can be made if at least two of the related criteria exist (recurrent abdominal or chest pain and arthritis) and persist for at least 1&#x2013;3&#x2009;days. In the case of a confirmed pathogenic or possibly pathogenic genetic anomaly, a single clinical attack is sufficient for the diagnosis of FMF [<xref rid="rkae083-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the genetic aetiology of FMF is complex; it is not only caused by pathogenic variations, PPVs and VUSs, but also by the interaction with epigenetic factors and other genes [<xref rid="rkae083-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Neurological symptoms defined in FMF are headache, myalgia, syncope, recurrent meningitis, vertigo, seizures, paraesthesia, demyelinating diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, posterior encephalopathy, prolongation of subclinical visual evoked potentials, pseudotumor cerebri and optic neuritis [<xref rid="rkae083-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a previous study reviewing risky genes for dystonia, the <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> gene was not listed [<xref rid="rkae083-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The fact that appendectomy was performed in the index case here because of fever and abdominal pain and that the pathological examination was reported as normal strongly supports that this was an FMF attack. This is frequently reported in undiagnosed patients with fever and abdominal pain, such as FMF [<xref rid="rkae083-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The index case and the sibling were evaluated as FMF and investigated in terms of neurological symptoms reported to be associated with FMF.</p>
      <p>Type 1 DM is caused by an autoimmune reaction against insulin-secreting pancreatic &#x3B2; cells [<xref rid="rkae083-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. IL-1&#x3B2; is released and insulin secretion is decreased with the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, which may cause the death of pancreatic &#x3B2; cells by causing activation of pro-apoptotic signalling pathways [<xref rid="rkae083-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dysfunction of pyrin leads to an impaired inflammasome, resulting in the upregulation of IL-1&#x3B2; [<xref rid="rkae083-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar to IL-6, IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that facilitates the differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells. Kumar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="rkae083-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that Th17 cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM. In addition to IL-1, NF-&#x3BA;B, NLRP3, impaired mitophagy, reactive oxygen species and chronic inflammation are also implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 DM [<xref rid="rkae083-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, the NF-&#x3BA;B and NLRP3 pathways are involved in the inflammatory process of FMF as well [<xref rid="rkae083-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IL-1 monoclonal antibodies are effective in the treatment of both DM and FMF [<xref rid="rkae083-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="rkae083-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus it can be asserted that the pathogenesis of type 1 DM and FMF involves numerous intersecting inflammatory pathways. There are three documented cases of patients with both type 1 DM and FMF [<xref rid="rkae083-B17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x2013;19</xref>]. One of these diabetic patients had undergone an appendectomy, similar to our index case [<xref rid="rkae083-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while another had additional autoinflammatory conditions [<xref rid="rkae083-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these reports did not indicate whether there was a family history of diabetes.</p>
      <p>Anwar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="rkae083-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] screened FMF gene variations in children with type 1 DM and found a higher rate of compound heterozygous mutations in these children. According to the literature, no information is available regarding the onset of diabetes, which may occur earlier as the FMF mutation burden increases. Therefore, the family described in this report is of particular significance. The co-occurrence of type 1 DM and FMF in this family, along with the early onset and more severe clinical presentation of DM in the siblings, suggests that additional <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> variations contribute to increased autoinflammation and play a crucial role in this deterioration. However, no report was detected on the relationship of VPS proteins with diabetes.</p>
      <p>The two siblings reported in this article have a fairly homogeneous clinical manifestation, presenting at similar ages and with the same variations: dystonia PPV, FMF PV and VUS. In the father, who had possible pathogenic dystonia-associated and FMF-associated pathogen gene variations, there was only diabetes and no clinical signs compatible with dystonia and FMF. Interestingly, no diabetes-associated variations were detected in any of the three. Did the coexistence of these two variations cause diabetes? Is the absence of dystonia and the FMF phenotype related to incomplete penetrance or the absence of a third VUS for FMF? The absence of signs and symptoms of these three diseases in the mother, who had an <italic toggle="yes">MEFV</italic> VUS, suggests that this variation alone is not effective. Did the coexistence of this unknown variation with the other two variations cause clinical findings of dystonia, diabetes and FMF? This needs to be investigated.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, although these two variations were seen coincidentally in this family, the increased FMF variation load and the earlier age of phenotype formation and clinical presentation suggest that the interaction between these two genes and the accumulation of FMF gene variations could determine phenotype presentation.</p>
