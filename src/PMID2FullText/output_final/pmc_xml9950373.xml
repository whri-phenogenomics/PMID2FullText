      <abstract id="Abs1">
        <p id="Par1">Mutations in the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes are associated with a diverse group of human disorders characterized by impaired mitochondrial respiration. Within this group, an increasing number of mutations have been identified in nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial RNA biology. The <italic>TEFM</italic> gene encodes the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor responsible for enhancing the processivity of mitochondrial RNA polymerase, POLRMT. We report for the first time that <italic>TEFM</italic> variants are associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency and a wide range of clinical presentations including mitochondrial myopathy with a treatable neuromuscular transmission defect. Mechanistically, we show muscle and primary fibroblasts from the affected individuals have reduced levels of promoter distal mitochondrial RNA transcripts. Finally, <italic>tefm</italic> knockdown in zebrafish embryos resulted in neuromuscular junction abnormalities and abnormal mitochondrial function, strengthening the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our study highlights that <italic>TEFM</italic> regulates mitochondrial transcription elongation and its defect results in variable, tissue-specific neurological and neuromuscular symptoms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Mitochondria play an essential role in regulating cellular homoeostasis as they are the main source of ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and they host a number of biosynthetic pathways. Thirteen essential subunits of the OXPHOS system are synthesized within the organelle. Mitochondria maintain and express the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that codes for these polypeptides, as well as the full set of mitochondrial (mt-) tRNAs and two mt-rRNAs. All remaining mitochondrial protein components are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into the mitochondria from the cytoplasm. This includes components of the mitochondrial transcription machinery such as the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), transcription initiation factors (mitochondrial transcription factor A&#x2014;TFAM and mitochondrial transcription factor B2&#x2014;TFB2M) and transcription elongation factor (TEFM). More than 50 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins involved in mitochondrial gene expression have been linked to heritable disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Transcription of human mtDNA initiates in the main non-coding region (NCR) from the L-strand (LSP) and H-strand (HSP) promoters and produces two, nearly genomic-length polycistronic precursor RNAs.

However, in contrast to bacteriophage polymerases, which can recognize promoters without auxiliary proteins, POLRMT requires additional factors. The association of POLRMT to TFAM and TFB2M is required for transcription initiation. TFAM is a DNA-binding protein that recruits POLRMT to the promoter for transcription activation, but also packages DNA in the nucleoid, whereas the key function of TFB2M is to modify the structure of POLRMT to induce promoter melting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>

Mitochondrial transcription and replication are functionally linked. LSP-derived transcripts are often prematurely terminated around the conserved sequence block II (CSB II) of the mtDNA major non-coding region (NCR) via the formation of a G&#x2010;quadruplex structure between nascent RNA and the non&#x2010;template strand of mtDNA.

        <title>Identification of TEFM variants</title>
        <p id="Par13">To identify the genetic cause for the observed phenotypes, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the patients and their parents and identified biallelic novel missense (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;4), frameshift (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1), splice site (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) or in-frame deletion (<italic>n</italic>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1) variants in the <italic>TEFM</italic> gene (ENST00000581216.6_1/NM_024683.4; Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). All missense variants detected showed strong evolutionarily conservation, except for p.(Lys188Arg), which showed little conservation (188Arg in the mouse), but may affect splicing as predicted by the Human Splicing Finder (HSf, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://umd.be/Redirect.html">http://umd.be/Redirect.html</ext-link>) and the spliceAI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org/">https://spliceailookup.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>) programmes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). However, consent was not obtained for a skin biopsy which may have allowed for confirmation of abnormal splicing in primary fibroblasts. Most of these variants were extremely rare or not reported in gnomAD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/">https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/</ext-link>) and predicted a damaging effect using Polyphen-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The compound missense variants found in P5 (Family 4) p.(Arg34Trp) (1.64e&#x2212;4; 41 heterozygotes in 249,466) and p.(Lys188Arg) (4.27e&#x2212;4; 120 heterozygotes in 280,950) have relatively high allele frequency in gnomAD, but no homozygotes were reported. The analysis of mRNA splicing in P4 (Family 3), carrying an intronic variant c.32-14A&gt;G (paternal) revealed skipping of exon 2 affecting approximately half of <italic>TEFM</italic> transcripts and predicting a frameshift and premature stop codon (p.Glu11Glyfs*2). Of the remaining transcripts that do encode exon 2, the maternally inherited c.484_489delGAAAGA variant was present in 70% of transcripts, consistent with allelic imbalance. The parents were healthy in all families and carried one heterozygous variant in each case. The second heterozygous variant detected in P4, c.484_489delGAAAGA, which results in the deletion of two amino acids (p.(Glu162_Arg163del)), was also detected in homozygosity in Family 5 (P6 and P7).

        <title>In silico characterization of TEFM variants</title>
        <p id="Par14">Next, we set out to model the effect of the detected variants on TEFM function. We used the structure of the TEFM dimer associated with POLRMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, in this the structural model of TEFM protein is not complete and lacks the N-terminal 145 amino acids, including the MTS and hairpin-hairpin-helix domain (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). All detected missense mutations that could be modelled on the existing structures are predicted to be localized in a solvent-exposed surface, opposite to the surface that interacts with POLRMT. The Pro157 residue is located near the dimerization interface of TEFM and, despite the lack of an evident hydrophobic environment in the surrounding region, its change to alanine may impact on the dimerization of this protein. This is supported by the participation of Ser210 from one of the TEFM monomers in the local environment of Pro157 of the other monomer. Furthermore, Pro157 is located at the end of a helix and may contribute to the delimitation of its secondary structure due to the conformational rigidity of proline conferred by its cyclic structure, which is not compatible with the angular requirements for helices. Hence, the p.(Pro157Ala) TEFM protein may present conformational differences compared to wild-type. The structural impact of the p.(Pro157Ala) variant is relatively limited, as alanine has a very short side chain, which is not expected to create a steric clash. Also, the nature of the side chains of proline and alanine are relatively similar (short and aliphatic), so there are no dielectric changes in this region of the protein. Taken together, there is no clear evidence to support the pathogenicity of the p.(Pro157Ala) TEFM variant from this structural analysis (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The Ile159 residue may also have a role in the dimerization of TFEM, or the stabilization of the interface. Substitution of isoleucine to a lysine is expected to disrupt the environment by adding an electric charge and introducing a bulky side chain. Furthermore, in the vicinity of Ile159, the side chain of Arg163 forms a polar interaction with the backbone of His271, which is potentially relevant for the overall structure of TEFM. Given this, p.(Ile159Lys) would introduce a positive charge and has a longer side chain, which could disrupt the Arg163-His271 interaction (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The loss of Glu162 and Arg163 in addition to impacting on the global structure as mentioned above, is also predicted to perturb a helical element which, although solvent-exposed, could have a role in maintaining long-range sequence interactions (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The side chain of Lys188 is exposed in the analyzed structure and is located in a loop between beta-strands, next to Arg187. Since the detected variant alters lysine to arginine, i.e. an amino acid with a similar charge and size, any predictions as to damaging properties of this change are difficult. On the other hand, the change to two consecutive arginines could result in stacking interactions, affecting the local environment. Taken together, based on in silico analysis, the prediction of pathogenicity is challenging and, therefore, we set out to investigate the effects of the detected variants in the following in vitro and cellular studies.</p>

        <title>Analysis of TEFM levels and OXPHOS function in affected individuals</title>
        <p id="Par15">In order to get further insights into the pathogenicity of the detected <italic>TEFM</italic> variants, we assessed the TEFM protein stability in patient-derived primary skin fibroblasts. The steady-state level of TEFM was substantially reduced in P2 and P3 fibroblasts as compared to the controls, consistent with our prediction of p.(Pro157Ala) (P2) and p.(Ile159Lys) (P3) impacting protein conformation and stability (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). However, further analysis of primary dermal fibroblasts from P2 and P3 by western blotting showed no substantial changes in steady-state levels of the OXPHOS components (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref>). Notwithstanding, a similar analysis of the OXPHOS subunits in fibroblasts of P4 showed reduced levels of NDUFB8 (complex I) and normal levels of the other OXPHOS components (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). Quantitative proteomics was used to confirm the levels of TEFM protein in P4 and assess the impact on complex I (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d, e</xref>, Supplementary Dataset). As can be seen in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, P4 fibroblasts show decreased amounts of TEFM protein (&#x2212;2.2 fold-change) relative to controls. It should be noted that TEFM protein was quantified from a single peptide sequenced by MS/MS in all samples (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Relative complex abundance profiling revealed a 25% reduction in the abundance of complex I subunits in P4 relative to controls. Complex II and complex IV presented a 12% and 7% reduction, respectively, while the mitoribosome presented a 10% increase in relative abundance (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of OXPHOS activities (complexes I and IV) in fibroblasts from P4 showed a 35% reduction in complex I, but no difference in complex IV (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b, c</xref>). The lack of OXPHOS phenotype observed in the patient fibroblasts, except P4, prompted us to analyze patient tissues affected by the disease. To this end we investigated the available quadriceps muscle (<italic>vastus lateralis</italic>) samples from the patients. In this analysis we detected markedly reduced protein levels of subunits from RC complexes I, III and IV in muscle of P1 &amp; P2 compared to control samples (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). These data show that p.(Pro157Ala) (Family 1, P1 and P2) and p.(Ile159Lys) (Family 2, P3) variants perturb the stability of the TEFM protein and in the case of P1 and P2 lead to a reduced stability of the OXPHOS components in the skeletal muscle. Furthermore, these results also demonstrate that the c.484_489delGAAAGA variant identified in Family 3 (P4), which is also found in Family 4 (P6 and P7), leads to reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>The levels of TEFM and OXPHOS components and mtDNA copy number in patient samples.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Western blot detecting the TEFM protein in human dermal fibroblasts from patients 2 (P2) and 3 (P3). &#x3B2;-actin was used as a loading control. <bold>b</bold> Representative example of western blot analysis of NDUFB9 (complex I, cI), SDHA (complex II, cII), UQCRC2 (complex III, cIII), MTCO1 (complex IV, cIV), and ATP5A (complex V, cV) for fibroblasts from patients 2 (P2) and 3 (P3) and wild-type controls (C2 and C3).

As TEFM is required for POLRMT processivity during the transcription elongation stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, we further investigated the effect of TEFM variants on mtDNA-encoded transcript steady-state levels. For this analysis, mt-rRNA reads corresponding to both strands were removed computationally. Skeletal muscle samples from P1 and 2 and fibroblast samples from P2, 3 and 6 showed a more severe decrease of promoter-distal mt-mRNA, consistent with the reduced levels of TEFM in patient samples (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b and d, e</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a&#x2013;f</xref>). The approach used for RNA-Seq library preparation did not allow for detection of free mt-tRNAs, however, in the conditions used mt-tRNA coding regions could be captured as a part of unprocessed transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Consequently, by specifically analyzing the mt-tRNA regions, we could assess the effect of the TEFM depletion on the steady-state of mt-tRNA precursors. While promoter-proximal mtRNA processing intermediates are upregulated in the patient samples, there is a strong decrease of intermediates more distal from the promoter, again confirming the deleterious effect on transcription elongation in absence of TEFM protein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c, f</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5c, f</xref>). The effects of <italic>TEFM</italic> inactivation have been previously studied in a mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Loss of TEFM in mouse heart led to a similar pattern of the steady-state levels of mt-tRNA as observed in skeletal muscle of P1 and P2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4c</xref>), with the most promoter proximal mt-tRNAs i.e. mt-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (the closed to HSP) and mt-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (close to LSP), being upregulated (likely due to an increase of transcription initiation events) and the rest on the mt-tRNAs being downregulated. Loss of TEFM in mouse heart also showed close to normal 12S rRNA levels, but a strong reduction of the more promoter-distal 16S rRNA and reduced levels of proteins from the large mitoribosomal subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In order to investigate if a similar effect could be detected in the patients, we analyzed rRNA levels in the patient fibroblast cells by RNA-Seq, without performing the rRNA depletion step (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). We detected the reduction of both mt-rRNAs in the patient samples compared to healthy controls, with the reduction being much greater for 16S rRNA, consistent with the observations in murine heart. Despite the lower mt-rRNA levels in patients&#x2019; fibroblasts, mRNA levels encoding protein components of the mitochondrial ribosomes were unchanged or slightly upregulated (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), similar to the unchanged levels of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins shown by western blot (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c</xref>). Taken together, our results show that the <italic>TEFM</italic> variants lead to reduced levels of promoter-distal transcripts, likely due to impaired transcription processivity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial transcriptome in TEFM patients.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Transcriptome-wide RNA-Seq analysis showing the effects of TEFM loss in skeletal muscle of patient 2 (P2) on mtRNA transcripts.

        <p id="Par18">In order to provide further evidence for the pathogenicity of identified <italic>TEFM</italic> variants, we set out to study how the presence of the missense substitutions or the deletion, p.E162_R163del (&#x394;162-163), variant affect the ability of the enzyme to regulate POLRMT processivity. Human TEFM (residues 36 to 360, lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence) and mutant variants were purified in recombinant form (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a</xref>). We first investigated if disease-causing mutations affect the stimulatory effect on POLRMT-driven transcription elongation. To this end, we performed run-off transcription using a linearized template containing LSP, in the presence of the different TEFM variants (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7b</xref>). We found that the processivity of POLRMT was affected by approx. 40% for the p.(Pro157Ala), p.(Ile159Lys) and (&#x394;162&#x2013;163) mutants and by approx. 60% for the p.(Lys188Arg) TEFM mutants, as compared to wild-type (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c</xref>). We next monitored the ability of wild-type TEFM and mutant derivatives to stimulate the processivity of POLRMT transcription driven from a supercoiled template containing LSP (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). In this assay, the processivity of POLRMT was affected by approx. 50% for the p.(Pro157Ala), p.(Ile159Lys) and p.(Lys188Arg) mutants, while only approx. 20% reduction was observed for the (&#x394;162-163) TEFM mutant, as compared to wild-type (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7e</xref>). The previous studies have shown that stimulation of POLRMT processivity by TEFM in vitro prevents the formation of G-quadraplexes at CSB II, helping the elongation complex to advance through this site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, we also tested the ability of TEFM mutants to prevent premature transcription termination at the CSB II region. To this end we performed in vitro transcription from linearized, LSP-containing templates harbouring three different CSB II sequences characterized by varying (G)-tract lengths: G5AG7, G6AG7 and G8AG8 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).

The variable severity and phenotypes associated with TEFM deficiency in humans may be due to differences in residual activity of the mutant enzyme or could be influenced by other factors affecting mitochondrial transcription and respiratory chain activity.</p>
      <p id="Par28">Autosomal recessive and dominant variants have been recently identified in the <italic>POLRMT</italic> gene in eight individuals from seven unrelated families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The clinical presentation of these patients resembles <italic>TEFM</italic> mutations with global developmental delay, hypotonia, short stature, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and/or epileptic seizures in childhood, while other subjects developed muscle weakness and atrophy or autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Brain MRI showed high signal intensity in the subcortical white matter in some patients, while volume loss of the white matter with ventriculomegaly and thinning of the corpus callosum in others, and some patients with predominant muscle involvement had normal brain MRI. Similarly, the clinical and brain abnormalities were diverse in our cohort of patients with <italic>TEFM</italic> variants, suggesting that mitochondrial transcription and its elongation are crucial for a wide range of neurons and for skeletal muscle. Diseases caused by <italic>POLRMT</italic> and <italic>TEFM</italic> mutations are similar and a wide variety of features overlap with other mitochondrial diseases, establishing defective mitochondrial transcription elongation as an important disease mechanism.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Some TEFM patients in our study show a prominent neuromuscular junction (NMJ) defect responsive to treatment, which has a positive impact on mobility and quality of life. The responsiveness of these patients to salbutamol, a drug commonly used to alleviate symptoms of fatigable muscle weakness in the Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (primary disorders of the NMJ), suggests an involvement of TEFM in neuromuscular structure or function. To investigate this, we generated a zebrafish model of TEFM deficiency using morpholino antisense oligonucleotide technology to knockdown expression of <italic>tefm</italic> during the first few days of development. The knockdown is mosaic, allowing the zebrafish to progress through development without experiencing severe, universal deficits in RC activity.</p>
      <p id="Par30">Fish with reduced expression of <italic>tefm</italic> moved significantly less over the period of 1&#x2009;min, as found in other zebrafish models of neuromuscular defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, and the duration of movements was longer, suggesting a slower twisting motion. Reduced movement occurs naturally as zebrafish move from 19&#x2009;h post fertilization (hpf) towards 27 hpf, or if development is delayed and movements have not yet initiated. However, we assessed the length and head angle of these fish to ensure they are at the same developmental time point and no differences were found<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In addition, a CRISPR/Cas9 F0 <italic>tefm</italic> knockout model also displayed defects in movement at 5 dpf, with defects becoming more pronounced over time of the assay, which may reflect some involvement of the NMJ. Further evidence towards a role for <italic>tefm</italic> in zebrafish NMJ development is provided by the decrease in co-occurrence of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic NMJ components on fast and slow muscle and a reduction in average pre-synaptic cluster size in <italic>tefm-</italic>MO fish. As the NMJ has a high concentration of mitochondria and requires energy for formation, vesicle release/recycling and assembly of the presynaptic cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, it is likely that the neuromuscular synapse is highly vulnerable to deficiencies in mitochondrial function. Alternatively, TEFM may have a role at the NMJ beyond promoting transcription elongation in mitochondria, rendering it important for proper synapse formation, however, further research will be required to address this. The detection of the presynaptic NMJ defect in <italic>tefm</italic>-MO treated zebrafish supports the link between <italic>TEFM</italic> variants and NMJ dysfunction and highlights that improving neuromuscular transmission may improve fatigability in patients carrying biallelic variants in the <italic>TEFM</italic> gene. Many mitochondrial disorders affect the brain, nerve and muscle, but neuromuscular transmission disturbances caused by mitochondrial defects have not been appreciated until very recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In a cohort of 80 patients with various genetic forms of mitochondrial disease, detailed clinical and neurophysiologic testing including single-fibre electromyography detected neuromuscular transmission defects in 26%. The highest prevalence was in patients with pathogenic dominant <italic>RRM2B</italic> variants (50%), but abnormalities were found in a wide range of mitochondrial genotypes, including common mtDNA variants. The presence of NMJ abnormalities was strongly associated with coexistent myopathy, however 15% of patients with NMJ abnormalities had no evidence of either myopathy or neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Whether modulators of neuromuscular transmission have a role in treating these patients has not been studied systematically.</p>
      <p id="Par31">Despite the increased utility of genetic testing and variant pathogenicity prediction tools, providing proof of pathogenicity of novel variants remains challenging. Follow up functional studies in vitro should, therefore, be included as an integral part of the evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Our multifaceted approach involving transcriptomics, quantitative proteomics, activity analysis of the recombinant TEFM protein and the assessment of the protein stability in cultured patient fibroblasts provided convincing pathogenicity evidence for the missense and deletion variants identified in P1&#x2013;4 and P6&#x2013;P7. It is unlikely that a single mutation can affect the dimerization of TEFM as the identified mutations are far from the dimer interface formed by the long alpha-helices in the C-terminus of TEFM. Most mutations cluster in an important structural element of TEFM - the linker subdomain, which has been previously identified as critical to TFEM function, and mutations there dramatically affect transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, the pathogenicity of the missense variants found in P5 remain somewhat unclear. Owing to the unavailability of P5 material, we could not test the effect of p.(Lys188Arg) and p.(Arg34Trp) on mitochondrial transcriptome, proteome or TEFM steady-state level. Both variants found in P5 have relatively high population allele frequency. While p.(Lys188Arg) had a clear detrimental effect on recombinant TEFM activity, we were unable to study the effect of the p.(Arg34Trp) change in the in vitro transcription assay, as it resides in the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which needs to be removed to allow the efficient production of the recombinant protein. The predicted length of the MTS in TEFM is 36 aa. The mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) recognizes a large variety of MTSs in mitochondrial preproteins and cleaves a single site, often including arginine, at the &#x2212;2 position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that Arg34 is the likely recognition site for the MPP.</p>
      <p id="Par32">The predicted length of the MTS in TEFM is 36 aa, it is possible that Arg34, which is the likely recognition site for the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), is absolutely conserved in mammalian TEFM. MPP recognizes a large variety of MTSs in mitochondrial preproteins and cleaves the single site, often including arginine, at the &#x2212;2 position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is expected that the p.(Arg34Trp) mutation found in P5 will result in a lack of TEFM processing in mitochondria and a partially unfolded and partially active protein.</p>
      <p id="Par33">Transcripts originating from LSP, which are prematurely terminated at CBSII have been suggested to act as primers for H-strand mtDNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Owing to the capability of TEFM to affect premature transcription termination at CSBII, it has been proposed to act as the switch between replication and transcription. According to this model, enhanced transcription termination at CSBII would yield more RNA primer resulting in more mtDNA replication, whereas reduced CSBII termination events would lead to higher readthrough and transcription rates (also see &#x201C;Introduction&#x201D;)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. TEFM normally stimulates transcription to pass through CSBII without termination. Here, we showed that the p.(Pro157Ala) TEFM mutant, identified in P1 and P2, had a reduced ability to prevent premature termination at CSB II, particularly with templates containing longer (G)-tract sequences (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c&#x2013;e</xref>). Furthermore, we observed in P1 and P2 skeletal muscle samples that mtDNA copy number was higher as compared to controls (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). These two results could potentially support the TEFM replication-transcription switch model. However, in vivo data obtained in the TEFM mouse knockout showed that the lack of TEFM did not result in upregulation of mtDNA replication initiation and the lack of TEFM caused a decrease in de novo mtDNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The observed upregulation of mtDNA copy number in TEFM knockout mice was attributed to the compensatory increase of mitochondrial biogenesis, typically occurring in severely respiratory chain deficient tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. P1 and P2 skeletal muscle samples also exhibited respiratory chain deficiency (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>) that could trigger mitochondrial biogenesis and provide an alternative explanation for the elevated mtDNA in this tissue. On the other hand, no increase in TOMM20 protein was observed, suggesting that mitochondrial mass was not changed in P1 and P2 skeletal muscle. More research would be required to test the TEFM-related replication-transcription switch model.</p>
      <p id="Par34">In summary, we report the identification and characterisation of pathogenic variants in the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor, TEFM, that underlie the mitochondrial disease-related presentations in seven patients from five families. Our in vivo and in vitro functional studies establish TEFM as a candidate disease gene that should be considered in the genetic diagnostic workup of patients that present with neonatal or childhood onset mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, fatigable muscle weakness, epilepsy and variable degree of intellectual disability. Neuromuscular transmission studies may reveal abnormal neuromuscular transmission in patients with fatigable muscle weakness carrying causative <italic>TEFM</italic> variants, which can benefit from Salbutamol therapy. Together with the recent report of several pathogenic variants in the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, POLRMT, our study indicates that defects in the human mitochondrial transcription machinery are more prevalent than previously thought.</p>

        <p id="Par64">Following the previously published method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, three predesigned CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting exon 2 and exon 3 of zebrafish <italic>tefm</italic> were chosen from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (IDT) (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>) Briefly, each crRNA (200&#x2009;&#xB5;M) was annealed to universal tracrRNA (200&#x2009;&#xB5;M) (IDT) in nuclease free duplex buffer (IDT) to form three individual guide RNAs (gRNA). Once annealed each gRNA was assembled into a Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with 57&#x2009;&#xB5;M Alt-R&#xAE; S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT) to a final RNP concentration of 28.5&#x2009;&#xB5;M. Before injection all three RNPs were pooled together to form the final injection mix. 1nL of injection mix was injected into the yolk of TLF wild type zebrafish, no older than 20&#x2009;min post fertilization from three separate clutches. Uninjected clutch mates were collected for controls. All embryos were subsequently kept at 28&#x2009;&#xB0;C in E3 medium (5&#x2009;mM NaCl, 0.17&#x2009;mM KCl, 0.33&#x2009;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33&#x2009;mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) until 5 dpf. Embryos were monitored for defects and dead embryos removed promptly. At 5 dpf, zebrafish were humanely culled and pools of 10 larvae were collected and frozen at &#x2212;80&#x2009;&#xB0;C.</p>

        <title>Confirmation of CRISPR/Cas9 tefm (F0) knockout generation</title>
        <p id="Par65">DNA was extracted from both 5 dpf, injected and uninjected (control) larvae pools (10 per pool), using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). PCR reactions were performed using primers flanking the three different mutagenesis target regions (primer sequences in Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). To establish if mutagenesis of the target regions was successful a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) was performed as described by Sorlien et. al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> PCR products were first purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) before heating to 100&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 3&#x2009;min to denature the DNA. Samples were then left to cool to room temperature for 1&#x2009;h to allow the formation of heteroduplex products. Samples were subsequently loaded into Novex&#x2122; TBE Gels, 20% (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and run at 150&#x2009;V for 3&#x2009;h. Gels were post-stained in 3X GelRed Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Biotium) solution for 1&#x2009;h at room temperature before being imaged on an Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by the presence of multiple high weight bands not present in the uninjected controls.</p>

        <title>RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, RT-qPCR in CRISPR/Cas9 tefm (F0) knockout zebrafish</title>
        <p id="Par66">RNA was extracted from pools of 10, 5 dpf zebrafish (injected or uninjected) that had been culled using MS-222 and frozen at &#x2212;80&#x2009;&#xB0;C. Samples were first homogenized using polypropylene pestles in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Followed by extraction according to the manufacturers protocol. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples with a TURBO DNA-<italic>free</italic> kit (Invitrogen) following the rigorous DNase treatment protocol. RNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop-2000 and cDNA synthesized using 500&#x2009;ng of RNA according to the manufacturers protocol (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR reactions were performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96 system in triplicates using the following mix per reaction: 1&#x2009;&#xB5;L cDNA (1/10 dilution), 9&#x2009;&#xB5;L nuclease free water (Ambion), 1.25&#x2009;&#xB5;L forward primer (10&#x2009;&#xB5;M), 1.25&#x2009;&#xB5;L reverse primer (10&#x2009;&#xB5;M) and 12.5&#x2009;&#xB5;L SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). RT-qPCR programme: initial denaturation of 95&#x2009;&#xB0;C for 3&#x2009;min followed by 39 cycles of 95&#x2009;&#xB0;C (10&#x2009;s) and 58&#x2009;&#xB0;C (1&#x2009;min). Following this, melt curve analysis was performed, ramping from 65&#x2009;&#xB0;C to 95&#x2009;&#xB0;C in 0.5&#x2009;&#xB0;C increments for 5&#x2009;s. Three biological replicates (pools of 10, 5 dpf zebrafish) were used per experimental group. Fold change was calculated via the 2<sup>-&#x394;&#x394;Ct</sup> method relative to <italic>eelf1a1la</italic>.

        <title>Spontaneous movement analysis of 5dpf tefm &#x2013; (F0) knockout zebrafish</title>
        <p id="Par67">At 5dpf, 48 uninjected control larvae and 48 <italic>tefm</italic> &#x2013; (F0) knockout larvae were placed into individual wells of a 96 well transparent microtiter plate in 200&#x2009;&#xB5;L of E3 medium. Using a Zantiks MWP (Zantiks. Ltd) system, the distance moved (mm) of each larva was recorded over the period of 80&#x2009;min while being exposed to either light or darkness for alternating periods of 10&#x2009;min. The movement during the first 5&#x2009;min of light and dark cycle 2&#x2013;4 was used in the final movement analysis to allow for initial habituation to the protocol and to avoid stimulus desensitization.</p>
