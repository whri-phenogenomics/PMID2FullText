        <p>Patients with severe developmental delay, dysmorphism, and brain abnormalities were identified as having pathogenic mutations in <italic>EXOC2</italic>, a critical component of the exocyst complex involved in vesicle trafficking, which caused secretory vesicle transport defects in patient-derived cell lines.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>The exocyst, an octameric protein complex, is an essential component of the membrane transport machinery required for tethering and fusion of vesicles at the plasma membrane. We report pathogenic variants in an exocyst subunit, <italic>EXOC2</italic> (<italic>Sec5</italic>). Affected individuals have severe developmental delay, dysmorphism, and brain abnormalities; variability associated with epilepsy; and poor motor skills. Family 1 had two offspring with a homozygous truncating variant in <italic>EXOC2</italic> that leads to nonsense-mediated decay of <italic>EXOC2</italic> transcript, a severe reduction in exocytosis and vesicle fusion, and undetectable levels of EXOC2 protein. The patient from Family 2 had a milder clinical phenotype and reduced exocytosis. Cells from both patients showed defective Arl13b localization to the primary cilium. The discovery of mutations that partially disable exocyst function provides valuable insight into this essential protein complex in neural development. Since EXOC2 and other exocyst complex subunits are critical to neuronal function, our findings suggest that <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants are the cause of the patients&#x2019; neurological disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vesicle transport plays a crucial role in the development of the brain and is central to the function of all neurons and glia. Neurotransmitter release at synapses is the dominant activity of mature neurons, but vesicle traffic is also vital for outgrowth and maintenance of axons, for synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, ion channels, and cadherins all require targeted transport to specific regions of the neuronal plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Burack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">G&#xE4;rtner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kelly and Grote, 1993</xref>). The delivery of post-Golgi vesicle cargo to the plasma membrane requires an initial vesicle tethering step, followed by fusion to the membrane (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Br&#xF6;cker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Dubuke and Munson, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sztul and Lupashin, 2006</xref>). The major tethering factor is a protein complex called exocyst. Neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles is, at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, independent of exocyst, but the complex is required for all other known types of vesicles, including the insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Murthy et al., 2003</xref>). Exocyst is also needed for dendrite arbor formation and spine maturation in hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Vega and Hsu, 2001</xref>). Components of the exocyst complex are enriched in actin-containing growth cones, synaptic boutons, and filopodia (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hazuka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Koon et al., 2018</xref>). When filopodia are suppressed, axons become disorientated (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bentley and Toroian-Raymond, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 1993</xref>), and consistent with a guidance role, filopodia are critical to the migration of neuronal growth cones (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Letourneau, 1981</xref>).</p>
      <p>The exocyst complex is conserved throughout most eukaryotic organisms and consists of eight subunits that are organized into two subcomplexes (SCs) of four subunits each (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Heider et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Mei and Guo, 2018</xref>). SC1 consists of EXOC1, EXOC2, EXOC3, and EXOC4. SC2 consists of EXOC5, EXOC6, EXOC7, and EXOC8. In humans, three closely related proteins, EXOC3, EXOC3L1, and EXOC3L2, have cell type&#x2013;specific expression; however, there are no other isoforms of EXOC2. In budding yeast, each of the eight exocyst subunits is structurally similar, with a long N-terminal &#x3B1;-helical region (the CorEx motif) that engages in coiled-coil interactions with the CorEx motif of a second subunit and a C-terminal region of short antiparallel helical bundles (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Mei et al., 2018</xref>). The basic structure of a mammalian exocyst is likely to be similar, but the amino acid sequences of the human subunits are only &#x223C;25% similar to those in yeast, and two of them (EXOC2 and EXOC8) bind to the small GTPases RalA and RalB (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fukai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mott et al., 2003</xref>), which are not present in yeast; thus, substantial differences in regulation of the complex likely exist. Indeed, although the yeast exocyst is believed to be a stable octamer, the mammalian complex, by contrast, is in a dynamic equilibrium between free subunits, SCs, and the intact octamer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). However, when and where they assemble relative to the arrival of exocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane remains to be established, and the molecular function of the exocyst complex in tethering and fusion remains unknown.</p>
      <p>Consistent with an essential function in membrane traffic, exocyst loss of function (LoF) is lethal in yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and mice and in multiple cell lines (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Armenti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Friedrich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Murthy et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Roumanie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, however, mutations in some subunits are tolerated. Budding yeast can survive LoF mutations of <italic>EXOC1</italic> (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Finger and Novick, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Novick et al., 1980</xref>), for example, and in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a truncation mutant of <italic>EXOC2</italic> that retains the CorEx motif allows organismal viability (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Sommer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Exocyst function is also important for proper delivery to the primary cilium of the Joubert syndrome protein Arl13b and for ciliogenesis in a wide range of cell and tissue types. Mutations or loss of exocyst function has been linked to ciliopathy (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fogelgren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Lipschutz, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Seixas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The identification of partially disabling mutants of the mammalian exocyst would be particularly valuable by providing new tools to probe biological function.</p>
      <p>Here, we report on two unrelated families with pathogenic variants in <italic>EXOC2</italic>. Affected individuals had developmental delay, dysmorphism, and brain abnormalities that in certain instances were associated with seizures and poor motor skills. By whole exome sequencing (ES), we identified pathogenic variants in <italic>EXOC2</italic> (RefSeq accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:refseq" xlink:href="NM_018303.6">NM_018303.6</ext-link>) that were homozygous in affected children from Family 1 [c.1309C&gt;T; p.Arg437*] and compound heterozygous in the affected child from Family 2 [c.389G&gt;A; p.Arg130His and c.1739T&gt;C; p.Leu580Ser]. Analysis of patient fibroblasts revealed reduced EXOC2 protein level in Family 1, impaired secretory vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane and defective bulk exocytosis, and impaired Arl13b localization to the primary cilium. Based on genetic and functional genomics findings, we suggest that the <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants we have identified are the cause of the neurological disorder in these patients.</p>

        <p>Here, we report on two unrelated families with pathogenic variants in the exocyst subunit <italic>EXOC2</italic>. Family 1 is a large consanguineous family with multiple children of Lebanese background. Affected individuals from two sub-branches in Family 1 were born after uncomplicated pregnancies; however, both sub-branches of Family 1 had reported miscarriages of unknown cause. Affected children had progressive microcephaly, congenital cataracts, severe global developmental delay, seizures, severe intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Patient 1 also had epilepsy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hypoplastic cerebellum and brainstem, white matter loss, thinning of the corpus callosum, severely hypoplastic hippocampi, and hypoplastic optic cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x2013;L</xref>). For additional clinical details see Materials and methods, Detailed patient reports section, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Table S1</xref>. One of the affected children is deceased, while the other requires full-time care. Family 2 had a child born to a nonconsanguineous Italian family. She had mild intellectual disability, dysmorphism, mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and poor fine and gross motor skills, and MRI revealed a &#x201C;molar tooth&#x201D; midbrain malformation and an abnormal structure of the cerebellar cortical pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, M&#x2013;R</xref>).</p>

            <p><bold>Clinical and brain imaging features of affected patients with <italic>EXOC2</italic>-related neurological disorder. (A&#x2013;F)</bold> Patient 1 (1:IV-2): In the axial sections, the pons and fourth ventricle have an abnormal shape, which is only in part reminiscent of the molar tooth appearance; there is ponto-cerebellar and brainstem hypoplasia (asterisks in C), with more severe involvement of the inferior vermis with respect to the other cerebellar structures; narrow isthmus (not shown here); severely hypoplastic under-rotated hippocampi (downward pointing arrows in E); thin corpus callosum with cavum septi and large ventricles; and midline thalamic fusion and hypoplastic caudate nuclei. Microcephaly was also noted, with dilated subarachnoid spaces in correspondence with the temporal poles (asterisk in D). <bold>(G&#x2013;L)</bold> Patient 2 (1:IV-8): The same observations apply as in Patient 1, but all observations are more severe. In particular, the brainstem and cerebellum are severely hypoplastic (asterisk in I and L), and the hippocampi are barely visible on both sides (see asterisks in H and upward-pointing arrows in K). The septum pellucidum is absent. Mild generalized atrophy is noted. <bold>(M&#x2013;R)</bold> Patient 3 (2:II-1): Molar tooth&#x2013;shaped pons and fourth ventricle in the axial sections (encircled in M and N); narrow isthmus; cerebellar vermis hypoplasia; cleft separating the two dysplastic areas of the vermis; rhombencephalosynapsis and vertical orientation of the folial pattern; and under-rotated hippocampi.</p>

        <p>In summary, the brain malformation is much more severe in Patients 1 and 2, but the malformation complex leading to the molar tooth sign is more visible in Patient 3. It is likely that the brainstem&#x2013;cerebellar malformation in Patients 1 and 2 is too severe to generate a molar tooth&#x2013;shaped appearance of the pons and cerebellar peduncles, as these structures are hypoplastic. Patients 1 and 2 have a number of additional abnormalities.</p>

        <p>The affected patient in Family 2 was confirmed to be compound heterozygous for two <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants: c.[389G&gt;A];[1739T&gt;C] p.[(Arg130His)];[(Leu580Ser)]. Each parent was heterozygous for one of the variants each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The global MAF of the c.389G&gt;A variant was 7.96e-05, according to gnomAD (allele count 6/251,314, heterozygous in non-Finnish European and Latino populations, no homozygotes reported), whereas the c.1739T&gt;C variant was not reported in that database. Examining the gnomAD database for all <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants in control populations, a total of 42 predicted LoF variant positions were reported (combined allele count of 97/10,295,746; combined MAF of 9.42e-06; no homozygote LoF variants reported), and 428 predicted missense variant positions were reported. There was a total combined missense allele count of 3,120/102,355,114; combined MAF of 3.05e-05. Regarding homozygous missense variants, only seven individuals were reported in gnomAD. The seven individuals had one of three homozygous missense variants, and all were benign (Polyphen2). These seven individuals with benign homozygous missense variants were from an African (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or South Asian (<italic>n</italic> = 1) population. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Table S3</xref>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup4">Table S4</xref>&#xA0;provide biallelic variants from exome data of Patients 2 and 3, respectively.</p>

        <p>Similar to fibroblasts, when protein levels were measured in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from affected individuals in Family 1, no EXOC2 protein was detected; however, EXOC2 protein levels in a parent (Patient 1:III-4) and an unaffected sibling (Patient 1:IV-7) or in controls were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). For functional experiments, fibroblasts were transduced with <italic>EXOC2</italic> lentiviral particles to restore EXOC2 protein levels, and transduced cells were selected with puromycin.

EXOC2 protein levels were restored back to control levels in Patient 2 fibroblasts, while EXOC2 protein levels in control fibroblasts and Patient 3 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since complete absence of EXOC2 protein is predicted to be embryonic lethal, we further examined fibroblasts from an affected individual in Family 1 and the affected individual in Family 2 compared with four control fibroblast lines using tandem mass tag (TMT) multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Table S2</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, EXOC2 was the most strongly reduced protein in Patient 2 fibroblasts compared with the mean from four control cell lines. The abundance of EXOC2 and housekeeping proteins GAPDH and VDAC2 was not highly variable in either control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>), indicating the robustness of the data. Additionally, the level of EXOC3 was also significantly altered (&gt;1.5-fold change) in Patient 2 fibroblasts, with other EXOC proteins also in lower abundance but to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>).

        <p>As an orthogonal approach, we created a mutation similar to that of Patient 2 in a normal murine mammary gland cell line. This line expresses endogenously tagged Exoc7-sfGFP, which is in SC2 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). A guide RNA was used to target exon 14 of the Exoc2 locus so as to create mutations by CRISPR/Cas9&#x2013;mediated nonhomologous end joining. Nonsense mutations in this exon would be predicted to truncate the protein product, resulting in an &#x223C;48-kD N-terminal fragment. We then probed cell lysates for Exoc2.

Because the cell population was polyclonal, full-length Exoc2 protein was also present from cells in which only one allele or neither allele was successfully edited. Using these cells, we next performed a coprecipitation assay using GFP-Trap beads to purify Exoc7-GFP and measured association with the full-length and truncated fragment of Exoc2. Strikingly, both the full-length and, to a lesser extent, the truncated fragment of Exoc2 were bound to Exoc7-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These data demonstrate that an N-terminal fragment of Exoc2, which contains the CorEx domain, can be expressed in cells and is able to associate with exocyst SC2.</p>

        <title>EXOC2 truncation does not affect the stoichiometry of EXOC4&#x2013;EXOC7 interaction</title>
        <p>Previously, we had found that loss of either Exoc4 or Exoc1 in normal murine mammary gland cells destabilizes the entire SC1, which consists of EXOC1&#x2013;4, preventing their binding to SC2 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we next asked if the mutant EXOC2 of Patient 2 impacts binding of EXOC4 to EXOC7. Cell lysates from control and Patient 2 fibroblasts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using EXOC7 antibody and blotted for EXOC4. Surprisingly, there was no significant decrease in coprecipitated EXOC4 from the Patient 2 fibroblasts compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The Rho GTPase GEF-H1 also interacts with the exocyst and was previously shown to directly bind to EXOC2 (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Pathak et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, we tested whether GEF-H1 can interact with the exocyst from Patient 2 fibroblasts. Interestingly, immunoprecipitated EXOC7 was associated with similar amounts of GEF-H1 from wild-type and Patient 2 fibroblasts, suggesting that, despite the very low level of truncated EXOC2, GEF-H1 can still associate with exocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Assessment of vesicle fusion rates in patient fibroblasts</title>
        <p>Depletion of exocyst subunits from cell lines by RNA interference or gene editing strongly reduces the efficiency of global vesicle fusions to the plasma membrane, measured using VAMP2-pHluorin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we asked if the <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants described above also impact vesicle fusion rates. VAMP2-pHluorin is a v-SNARE fusion to a pH-sensitive GFP that marks the majority of exocytic vesicles in a cell and becomes highly fluorescent only upon vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Control, Patient 2, and Patient 3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with VAMP2-pHluorin, and fusions were assessed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x2013;D</xref>). The fusion rate was calculated as the number of fusions per unit area per second. Representative 3D kymographs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, in which sudden, short bursts of fluorescence denote fusion events. Fusion rates were significantly reduced (by &gt;50%) in Patient 2 fibroblasts harboring the p.Arg437* variant compared with control human fibroblasts; however, no significant change in global fusion rates was detected for fibroblasts from Patient 3 with compound heterozygous <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). To test if the reduction in vesicle fusion rate for Patient 2 fibroblasts is causally related to the mutation in EXOC2, we performed a rescue experiment. Confirming this hypothesis, lentiviral expression of EXOC2 restored the protein to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) and increased vesicle fusions by approximately twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Altered vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG)&#x2013;GFP surface exposure in fibroblasts from affected patients</title>
        <p>We next probed the impact on specific cargo delivery by the pathogenic <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants. We used a temperature-sensitive form of VSVG fused to GFP (VSVG-GFP ts045) as a well-validated marker protein for transport along the secretory pathway and exocytosis (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed and Macara, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Liljedahl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ren and Guo, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Yeaman et al., 2001</xref>). This protein construct misfolds at higher temperatures (40&#xB0;C) and accumulates in the ER. When cells are returned to permissive temperature (32&#xB0;C), the construct exits the ER and is transported via the Golgi to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>). The construct normally reaches the cell surface after 60&#x2013;120 min (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). To examine the final fusion of VSVG-GFP with the plasma membrane, immunostaining was performed on nonpermeabilized cells for an epitope on the extracellular domain of VSVG using the monoclonal 8G5 antibody (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lefrancois and Lyles, 1982</xref>). We transfected fibroblasts with the VSVG-GFP ts045 construct, held them at the restrictive temperature (40&#xB0;C) overnight, and then shifted them to the permissive temperature (32&#xB0;C), synchronously triggering release from the ER. To quantify fusion efficiency, cells were fixed at regular intervals and then counterstained with 8G5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E&#x2013;I</xref>). The amount of VSVG-GFP protein on the surface was normalized to the total amount of VSVG-GFP protein in the cells. Notably, the amount of VSVG-GFP detected by 8G5 on the plasma membrane was significantly reduced in both Patient 2 and Patient 3 fibroblasts compared with control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm that exocytosis is delayed by the <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants, we performed rescue experiments. Lentiviral transduction of wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic> into control fibroblasts had no impact on exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). However, expression of wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic> in fibroblasts from Patient 2 restored protein levels back to that of control fibroblasts and completely reversed the level of VSVG-GFP exocytosis to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, F and H</xref>). Interestingly, lentiviral transduction with wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic> into fibroblasts from Patient 3 did not restore their exocytosis defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 I</xref>); however, basal EXOC2 protein levels were not reduced in this patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These experiments suggest that there is an exocytosis defect that can be explained by the truncation and reduced levels of EXOC2 protein in Patient 2, but in Patient 3 the compound missense variants appear to interfere dominantly with exocytosis.</p>

        <title>EXOC2 variants affect ciliogenesis in patient fibroblasts</title>
        <p>The molar tooth midbrain malformation manifested by Patient 3 suggests that developmental defects that could be related to ciliopathy (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Urdiroz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Valente et al., 2013</xref>). Exocyst subunits are known to localize to the basal body and primary cilium, and loss of exocyst function has been linked to ciliopathy (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Fogelgren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Nihalani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Zuo et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we asked if cilia formation is affected in fibroblasts derived from patients with <italic>EXOC2</italic> mutations. We serum-starved the cells for 24&#x2013;48 h and stained for acetylated &#x3B1;-tubulin to mark primary cilia. Surprisingly, there was no significant change in the fraction of ciliated cells between control and Patient 2 cells. A slight decrease was detected between control and the Patient 3 variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>), but this is likely a cell line&#x2013;specific phenotype, as introduction of exogenous EXOC2 did not elevate cilia number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Additionally, we detected no significant difference in cilia length between the variants and control fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Finally, we examined the localization of Arl13b to the primary cilium. Arl13b was previously reported to interact with EXOC2 and EXOC4 (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Seixas et al., 2016</xref>). Arl13b localization to the cilia of Patient 2 and Patient 3 cells was reduced by &#x223C;30% and &#x223C;50%, respectively, compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, F and G</xref>). This localization defect was rescued to wild-type levels upon exogenous expression of full-length wild-type EXOC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, E&#x2013;G</xref>). We note that overexpression of EXOC2 in control cells reduced the localization of Arl13b to the cilia. We suggest that this effect is the result of excess EXOC2 subunit that cannot integrate into the complex, but which can independently associate with Arl13b (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Seixas et al., 2016</xref>) and may prevent its proper localization to the cilium. We conclude that while ciliogenesis in the EXOC2 variant cells appears normal, Arl13b recruitment to the cilia is compromised by mutations in EXOC2.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This work expands the number of exocyst genes associated with human disease, where we identify the first patients with pathogenic variants in <italic>EXOC2</italic>. The affected patients manifested a variable association of early-onset seizures, variable intellectual disability, microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental brain abnormalities, including a characteristic molar tooth midbrain malformation revealed by brain MRI. To our knowledge, there are no other reported pathogenic variants in human <italic>EXOC2</italic>, and the only disease associations for the exocyst complex are for <italic>EXOC8</italic> (MIM: 615283) and <italic>EXOC4</italic> (MIM: 608185). <italic>EXOC8</italic> was found to harbor a pathogenic homozygous variant in a single case report of a boy diagnosed with Joubert syndrome (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Dixon-Salazar et al., 2012</xref>). Joubert syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a molar tooth formation on brain imaging, with an underlying classical ciliopathy phenotype (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Doherty, 2009</xref>). More recently, heterozygous <italic>EXOC4</italic> variants have been linked to nephrotic syndrome in patients (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Nihalani et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
      <p>In affected individuals from Family 1 exhibiting a severe neurological condition, a homozygous variant (c.1309C&gt;T p.Arg437*) leads to nonsense-mediated decay of <italic>EXOC2</italic> transcripts, undetectable EXOC2 protein, and impaired exocytosis and vesicle fusion, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic>. In the affected individual from Family 2 with compound heterozygous variants in <italic>EXOC2</italic> (c.389G&gt;A; p.Arg130His and c.1739T&gt;C; p.Leu580Ser), transcript and protein levels were normal, but exocytosis (measured by tsVSVG-GFP surface exposure) was impaired. However, no significant defects in global steady-state vesicle fusions could be demonstrated using VAMP2-pHluorin. This difference might reflect a less severe defect that becomes more penetrant upon increased demand for membrane fusions, as occurs when tsVSVG-GFP is synchronously released from the ER. Interestingly, the defect in exocytosis of VSVG-GFP occurred even though EXOC2 levels are normal and was not rescued by transduction with wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic>. Possibly, the compound heterozygous missense mutations are dominant over wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic>, or cells may not allow overexpression of <italic>EXOC2</italic> as previously suggested (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Rivera-Molina and Toomre, 2013</xref>). We are confident these &#x201C;rescued&#x201D; cells were successfully transduced with the lentiviral vector carrying the wild-type <italic>EXOC2</italic>, as cells were maintained under puromycin selection for 16 d after transduction, and in parallel cultures treated with puromycin, all cells died off after 3&#x2013;4 d. Notably, expression of the exogenous wild-type EXOC2 was observable in fibroblasts from Patient 2. An additional consideration is that the milder phenotype of Patient 3 compared with Patient 2 could partially be explained by the less severe exocytosis defect as measured in fibroblasts.</p>
      <p>We also discovered that the pathogenic mutations in <italic>EXOC2</italic> affect proper localization of Arl13b to primary cilia, possibly caused by delayed recruitment to the cilia or defective tethering by mutant exocyst. We did not find any defects in cilia number or length. However, it is possible that localization of ciliary membrane proteins such as Smoothened and Patched is affected by reduced Arl13b recruitment in these patients (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Larkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Revenkova et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in <italic>ARL13B</italic> cause classical Joubert syndrome (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>), and we suggest that the molar tooth formation in Patient 3 with compound heterozygous mutations in <italic>EXOC2</italic> is at least partially due to defects in protein transport within the primary cilia.</p>
      <p>Essential roles for EXOC2 have also been revealed in model organisms. In <italic>Drosophila Sec5</italic> (<italic>EXOC2</italic>), null mutants had impaired neuronal membrane traffic that led to failure of neuronal polarization and neuromuscular junction expansion (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Murthy et al., 2003</xref>). Neurite outgrowth was arrested when the maternal supply of Sec5 was exhausted (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Murthy et al., 2003</xref>). A <italic>Drosophila Sec15</italic> (<italic>EXOC6</italic>) knockout demonstrates that <italic>Sec15</italic> is critical for a specific vesicle trafficking event that ensures the correct polarized, asymmetrical cell division of progenitor cells and proper cell fate specification (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Jafar-Nejad et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Exo70 mutants exhibited impaired integral membrane trafficking to the cell surface, severe neurite outgrowth defects, and reduced synaptic growth at the neuromuscular junction (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Koon et al., 2018</xref>). All other existing full knockouts of exocyst genes are lethal in mice at the blastocyst stage (reviewed in <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Urdiroz et al., 2016</xref>). These observations are consistent with our data and with the fact that deletion of the initiation exon of <italic>EXOC2</italic> in the patient fibroblasts dramatically reduces viability of the cells. It is therefore possible that low levels of truncated EXOC2 protein expressed in cells with the p.Arg437* mutation is able to interact through its CorEx domain with other exocyst subunits to facilitate assembly of semi-functional complexes and enable vesicle fusions. We speculate that the truncated EXOC2 binds only weakly but functions catalytically to promote assembly of a hexameric or heptameric exocyst complex. The effect of the truncation mutant on the overall structure and stability of the exocyst complex requires further investigation.</p>
      <p>In summary, we describe a large consanguineous family with a homozygous variant in <italic>EXOC2</italic>, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of <italic>EXOC2</italic> transcript and a severe reduction in exocytosis and vesicle fusion due to undetectable levels of EXOC2 protein in individuals with the truncating <italic>EXOC2</italic> variant p.Arg437*, which may explain their severe neurological defect. We also describe a second patient with a milder clinical phenotype who harbors compound heterozygous missense variants in <italic>EXOC2</italic> that lead to reduced exocytosis. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the exocyst complex for brain development. Ongoing research is likely to identify other individuals with pathogenic <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants, which will provide invaluable new tools to probe the structure and function of the exocyst complex.</p>

          <p>Patient 1 was the second-born child to consanguineous Lebanese parents. The pregnancy was complicated by intrauterine growth restriction, leading to elective delivery at 36 wk of gestation. His birth parameters at 36 wk gestation were: weight, 2,025 g (10th centile); length, 47 cm (50th centile); and head circumference (occipital frontal circumference [OFC]), 30 cm (less than third centile).</p>

He had a long flat philtrum and thin upper lip, simple helices, and low-set ears. Patient 1 had deep palmar creases and clenched hands, persistent camptodactyly of fingers, congenital hip dysplasia, broad great toes with hypoplastic second to fifth toenails, and an overriding second toe. He had fine lanugo hair over his back.</p>
          <p>Congenital anomalies: Patient 1 had a cardiac abnormality of a ventricular septal defect that was surgically closed. He had bilateral congenital cataracts detected and surgically removed at age 2 yr, with lens replacement. Patient 1 had underdeveloped male external genitalia with a hypoplastic scrotum and undescended testes (left, high scrotal; right, external inguinal ring). He had orchidopexy at age 2 yr.</p>
          <p>Poor weight gain and difficulties feeding: Patient 1 had feeding difficulties requiring nasogastric tube feeds from birth, with later fundoplication and insertion of gastrostomy tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeds until age 5 yr. Growth parameters at 5 yr are as follows: height, 101.2 cm (third centile); weight, 15.3 kg (fifth centile). He had poor weight gain and a recurrent aspiration managed by reinsertion of gastrostomy tube at age 8 yr. Height, 121.5 cm (&gt;10th centile for 8-yr-old); weight, 22.3 kg (10th centile for 8-yr-old).</p>
          <p>Endocrine: At age 3 mo, Patient 1 presented with increased sodium (serum sodium = 150 mmol/liter) and was diagnosed with partial diabetes insipidus based on a diagnostic water deprivation test. No specific treatment was given. Serum sodium was 145 mmol/liter (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 145); serum osmolarity was 301 mmol/kg (reference range 265&#x2013;295 mmol/kg) and random urine osmolality was 179 mmol/kg.</p>
          <p>Global developmental delay and postnatal microcephaly: Patient 1 had severe global developmental disability with progressive postnatal microcephaly. He walked at age 4.5 yr and was noted to have increased tone in the lower limbs with limitation of full extension at the knees and hips. He walked with increasingly ataxic gait. He could walk short distances but required a mobility device (stroller) for longer distances and school. He remained nonverbal and not toilet trained. His OFC was 44 cm (less than first centile) at age 5 yr and remained static thereafter (OFC, 44 cm at 8 yr of age).</p>
          <p>Seizures: Patient 1 had seizures with onset at age 5 yr, initially with daily focal seizures that progressed to generalized seizures. He was commenced on anticonvulsant medications but experienced increasing seizures with age despite treatment with several anticonvulsants.</p>
          <p>Recurrent bacterial infections: At 6 yr of age, Patient 1 had a group A streptococcal septicemia diagnosed on blood culture. The diagnosis was associated with a swollen painful elbow. He frequently had elevated inflammatory marker levels, including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A diagnosis of Aicardi-Gouti&#xE8;res syndrome was considered at 7&#x2013;8 yr of age. He had recurrent aspiration pneumonia, leading to reinsertion of a gastrostomy tube at age 8 yr.</p>
          <p>He died at age 10 yr at home.</p>
          <p>Diagnostic investigations: Patient 1 had an electroencephalogram in 2013, which showed right posterior epileptiform foci. MRI of the brain initially at age 1 mo revealed hypoplasia inferior cerebellar vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. There was a normal pituitary bright spot. A scan at 6 yr showed a hypoplastic inferior cerebellar vermis and cerebellar hemispheres; a large fourth ventricle; decreased supratentorial white matter volume and thinning of the corpus callosum; frontal horn cysts; and cerebral atrophy. Patient 1 had a comparative genomic hybridization array at 1 yr of age which identified a heterozygous 8q21.3 deletion (3.2 Mb max). Both parents are heterozygous carriers. The exome sequencing incidental findings included a paternally inherited variant of unknown significance in <italic>IFIH1</italic> gene (c.1204G&gt;T; p.Glu402*). It should be noted that for <italic>IFIH1,</italic> gain of function variants have been reported in Aicardi-Gouti&#xE8;res&#x2013;like syndromes, not loss of function variants. Patient 1 had diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitter assessments (age 6 yr), and no abnormality was detected (neopterin, 24.3 &#x3BC;mol/mol); previously elevated neopterin measured at age 3 mo was 128.8 &#x3BC;mol/mol). Patient 1 had Angelman syndrome and Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome methylation tests, both of which were normal.</p>

          <title>Family 1, Patient 2 (1:IV-8)</title>
          <p>Patient 2 was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Her birth parameters at 37 wk were: weight, 2,826 g (&lt;50th centile); length, 52.3 cm (&gt;90th centile); and OFC, 32.2 cm (&gt;10th centile).</p>
          <p>Progressive microcephaly: Patient 2 had progressive microcephaly. Her OFC at 5 mo was 40 cm (10th centile); length, 63 cm (50th centile); and weight, 6.65 kg (50th centile). Her OFC at 20 mo was 45.3 cm (10th centile); height, 84 cm; and weight, 11.9 kg (50th centile). Her OFC at 4.4 yr was 46 cm (less than first centile).</p>
          <p>Physical examination: Physical examination at 20 mo revealed hypertelorism (with an interpupillary distance in the 97th centile); sacral dimple; anteriorly placed anus; normal female external genitalia; slight camptodactyly of fingers; clinodactyly of fifth finger; and bilateral hip dysplasia; and progressive S-shaped scoliosis of upper lumbar spine and lower thoracic spine. Progressive joint contractures have evolved over time and have been managed with orthotics and surgical tenotomy. At the age of 8 yr, she is able to walk with the aid of orthotics.</p>
          <p>Gastrointestinal tract: Patient 2 had recurrent diarrhea with patchy inflammation in her stomach and ascending and transverse colon. She has been treated with Salazopyrin since age 7 yr, with a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.</p>
          <p>Development: Patient 2 crawled at 20 mo; however, she was unable to pull herself up to stand. She walked at 2.5 yr. She was nonverbal after having a few babble words at 5 mo, which were subsequently lost.</p>
          <p>Diagnostic investigations: Patient 2 had an MRI of the brain at 20 mo, which revealed hypoplastic optic discs; generalized decrease myelination; frontal horn cysts; fusion of thalami; and hypoplastic brainstem and cerebellum. She had a single nucleotide polymorphism array (Sureprint G3 Human Comparative Genomic Hybridization [CGH] + SNP array) at 6 yr of age, which revealed an 8q21.3 deletion that was shared with two unaffected siblings, including one who is homozygous for the deletion. Both parents are heterozygous carriers. She had ~7.2% identity by descent over 10 autosomes; and shared only two regions in common with an affected cousin: 8p21.1q12.1 (~34 Mb) and chromosome 20p12.1 (~23.46 Mb). She had shared loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 8p21.1q12.1; 8q13.3q22.3. The LOH was present in affected cousins, including the deletion region. The other unaffected cousin studied had 9.2% identity by descent over 10 autosomes and eight shared regions of LOH. Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous EXOC2 (chr 6p25.3) that is outside the long segments of LOH. No candidate gene abnormalities were identified within the shared LOH regions. No abnormalities in serum transferrin isoforms were detected. Serum 7-dehydrocholesterol was not detected.</p>

          <p>At age 4 yr, she received a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with adenotonsillar hypertrophy leading to adenotonsillectomy.</p>
          <p>At age 6 yr 3 mo, her growth parameters were: weight, 21.2 kg (50&#x2013;75th centile); height, 116.5 cm (50th centile); and OFC, 54.6 cm (&gt;98th centile).</p>
          <p>Dysmorphology: Patient 3 had an oval face with slight bitemporal hollowing, a high forehead, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism (interpupillary distance at the 97th percentile), low-set simplified ears, thin upper lip with Cupid&#x2019;s bow, lateralized nipples, and slightly dry skin.</p>
          <p>Neuropsychological evaluation: Patient 3 had borderline intellectual functioning according to Wechsler Preschool &amp; Primary Scale of Intelligence at 6 yr of age (verbal IQ = 84; performance IQ = 73; full-scale IQ = 75; unchanged at 8 yr). She had good comprehension and adequate lexical understanding. She had poor spontaneous expressive language with incomplete phonetic inventory. She had poor fine and gross motor skills and articulatory difficulties.</p>
          <p>Diagnostic investigations: All of Patient 3&#x2019;s routine laboratory testing and metabolic investigations were unremarkable. Electroencephalogram multiple recordings (between age 9 mo and 6 yr) were normal. An MRI of the brain identified a molar tooth cerebellar abnormality, associated with vermis hypoplasia and rhombencephalosynapsis, and abnormal structure of the cerebellar cortical pattern. Patient 3 had an Array-CGH and targeted panel analyses of 28 genes associated with Joubert syndrome and of 82 genes associated with brain malformations; all results were all unrevealing. ES identified compound heterozygosis for two missense <italic>EXOC2</italic> variants: NM_018303.6:c.[389G&gt;A];[1739T&gt;C] (p.[Arg130His];[Leu580Ser]).</p>
          <p>Most recent clinical evaluation: Patient 3 attends the second year of primary school with support. An ophthalmological examination was unremarkable. An abdominal ultrasound examination showed a small accessory spleen (8 mm). Overnight pulse oximetry showed oxygen desaturation clusters suggestive of mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.</p>

        <p>Genomic DNA was obtained from whole blood cells from all affected individuals and their available relatives using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>
        <p>DNA from Patients 1 and 2, their siblings, and both parents was sequenced using ES and primary bioinformatics processing that included short sequence read alignment and variant calling on all sequenced samples. Variants were annotated with Annovar (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and filtered based on frequencies from ExAC (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Lek et al., 2016</xref>), gnomAD (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Karczewski et al., 2019</xref><italic> Preprint</italic>), and the 1000 Genomes Project (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Auton et al., 2015</xref>). Variants were selected based on the following criteria: amino acid changing (nonsynonymous/stop-gain single-nucleotide variants [SNVs], insertions-deletions, and splicing site variants within 10 bp of exon-intron boundaries); ExAC allele frequency below 1 &#xD7; 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>; predicted to be deleterious in SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant), damaging in PolyPhen-2, and conserved in PhyloP; and with balanced alleles for heterozygous calls (depth ratio below 3:1).</p>
        <p>For single-sample analysis, homozygous as well as compound heterozygous variants, both indicative of a recessive inheritance, were discarded if the alternative allele&#x2019;s population frequency in the ExAC, 1000 Genomes Project, or internal datasets was &gt;0.5%; heterozygous variants, in this case dominant de novo candidates, were discarded if the alternative allele frequency was &gt;0.1%. Confirmatory Sanger sequencing was completed in genomic DNA samples from all available family members. Multiple alignment of protein sequences was performed using the Uniprot ClustalO alignment tool and Uniprot database sequences.</p>
        <p>ES on Patient 3 and both of her parents was done with the SureSelectXT Clinical Research Exome kit (Agilent Technologies) for library preparation and target enrichment. Captured DNA libraries were sequenced by a paired-end 2 &#xD7; 150&#x2013;bp protocol on the NextSeq500 (Illumina). Sequencing reads were aligned to the GRCh37/hg19 human genome reference assembly by the BWA software package and then processed by using the Genome Analysis Toolkit suite for base quality score recalibration (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>), realignment of insertion/deletions (InDels), and variant calling, according to Genome Analysis Toolkit Best Practice recommendations (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>). Variants annotation was done by VarSeq software (Golden Helix, Inc; v1.4.6), which was also used for family- and frequency-based filtering. Only exonic/splice-site SNVs and coding InDels with MAF &lt;0.01 in the gnomAD v2.1; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Karczewski et al., 2019</xref><italic> Preprint</italic>) were taken into consideration. The potential functional impact of SNVs and InDels was evaluated by the precomputed genomic variants score from dbNSFP (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), which was integrated in the annotation pipeline. For selected variants, visual inspection of the quality of reads alignment was done using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (v2.4; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Thorvaldsd&#xF3;ttir et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
        <p>The potential functional impact of SNVs and InDels was evaluated by standard in silico prediction tools SIFT (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>), PolyPhen-2 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adzhubei et al., 2010</xref>), and CADD (combined annotation-dependent depletion; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Rentzsch et al., 2019</xref>).

Alkylated peptides from individual samples were individually labeled with TMT10plex TMTs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a ratio of 8 &#xB5;g tag to 1 &#xB5;g protein. Samples were then mixed at a 1:1 ratio and peptides purified using the column provided by the PreOmics iST-NIH kit.

Individual fractions were subsequently concentrated, and peptides were reconstituted in 2% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA. Liquid chromatography&#x2013;coupled tandem mass spectrometry was performed on an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a nanoESI interface in conjunction with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoHPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000).

        <title>Transfections</title>
        <p>For vesicle fusion experiments, 7 &#xD7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells were transfected with 3 &#xB5;g total cDNA using Human Dermal Fibroblast Nucleofector Kit (Lonza). Amaxa protocol U-022 delivered optimal transfection efficiency and cell survival. Cells were allowed to recover in the cell growth medium as above for 48&#x2013;72 h after transfection, at which time vesicle fusions could be measured reliably.</p>

        <title>Live-cell TIRFM imaging and analysis</title>
        <p>The growth media for human fibroblasts were changed to DMEM FluoroBrite supplemented with 10% FBS 30 min before imaging. Cells were imaged using a TIRFM setup under a temperature-controlled environment (Tokai Hit) maintained at 37&#xB0;C. Images were captured using Photometrics Prime 95B camera mounted on a Nikon Ti-2 microscope using Apo-TIRF 100&#xD7;/1.49 oil-immersion or Apo-TIRF 60&#xD7;/1.49 oil-immersion objective. Image acquisition was performed using NIS Elements Advanced Research Imaging software (version 4.60.00 [Build 1171] Patch 02). Images were processed and analyzed with NIS Elements and Matlab. Vesicle fusion events were analyzed by overlaying the time series images to determine all spots and by creating regions of interest around them as described previously (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>). The fluorescence trace over time was extracted and analyzed using Matlab to determine bona-fide fusion events.</p>

        <title>Ciliogenesis assays</title>
        <p>Cells were plated on Lab-TekII 8-well chamber-slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following day, cell culture medium was changed to DMEM with no serum and grown for an addition 24&#x2013;48 h to promote ciliogenesis. For rescue experiments, cells were transduced with EXOC2 lentivirus (pLX301-EXOC2) and selected for viral expression with puromycin (3 &#xB5;g/ml). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained using anti&#x2013;acetyl&#x2013;&#x3B1;-tubulin (Lys40; 1:1,000; D20G3; Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-Arl13b (1:750; Proteintech) followed by Alexa488&#x2013;labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Confocal images were taken using the same acquisition setting from several fields using a Nikon CFI Plan Fluor 40&#xD7;/1.3 oil immersion objective. For cilia counts, we compared the number of nuclei and cilia in each field for multiple fields. For cilia length, lines were drawn along the shape of the cilia, and the distance from the base to the tip was measured. To assess Arl13b intensity in the cilia, images were thresholded to specifically create binary masks on cilia. To ensure specificity of the masking, objects were confirmed to be associated with a cell nucleus by overlaying with Hoechst stain. Intensities of the individual regions of interest were then recorded using NIS Elements software. To assess successful expression of exogenous wild-type EXOC2 in mutant cells, we stained cells with anti-EXOC2 rabbit monoclonal antibodies (Abcam) followed by Alexa488-labeled rabbit secondary antibodies.</p>
