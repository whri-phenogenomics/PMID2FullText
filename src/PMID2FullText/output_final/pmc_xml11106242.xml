      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">The essential function of the 20 cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) is high-fidelity decoding of genetic information carried by mRNA during protein synthesis. The aaRSs catalyze ATP-dependent charging of tRNAs with cognate amino acids for delivery to the ribosome A-site. Pathogenic variants in cytosolic aaRSs are associated with several neurological disorders with myelination defects including epileptic encephalopathy, progressive microcephaly, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and there is emerging interest in aaRSs as potential therapeutics and therapeutic targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Nine of the twenty aaRS activities [in eight proteins since EPRS1 contains two covalently linked synthetase domains, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) and prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS)] reside in a cytoplasmic multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) with three non-synthetase proteins, AIMP-1, &#x2212;2, and &#x2212;3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Remarkably, pathogenic variants in seven of eleven MSC constituents cause a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. Pathogenic variants in <italic>QARS1</italic> and <italic>KARS1</italic> cause progressive microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, peripheral neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and progressive leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord calcifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, bi-allelic missense variants in genes encoding three other aaRSs&#x2014;<italic>RARS1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, <italic>DARS1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and <italic>EPRS1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, cause childhood-onset HLD, specifically HLD9, HBSL (hypomyelination with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity), and HLD15, respectively. Variants in two non-aaRS MSC components&#x2014;<italic>AIMP1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and <italic>AIMP2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>&#x2014;also cause white matter disorders, but the underlying pathology is demyelination secondary to neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p id="Par4">The leukodystrophies are a family of more than 50 distinct heritable central nervous system (CNS) disorders characterized by diminished cerebral and cerebellar white matter due to dysregulated myelin formation or degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. HLD is rare, but comprises the single largest category among undiagnosed genetic leukodystrophies, which collectively impacts ~1 in 7500 live births, representing a major group of neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Clinical features include severe cognitive and motor impairment with onset in early childhood or adolescence. At present there are no curative treatments; patient management includes serial brain MRI to monitor hypomyelination, genetic testing to elucidate etiology, and symptomatic treatment of neurologic and other medical complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The causative role of multiple aaRS variants in HLD is well-established, however, a unified hypothesis delineating the mechanism by which variant aaRSs cause HLD has not yet emerged. For nearly all <italic>EPRS1</italic> and <italic>RARS1</italic> variants, the relevant aminoacyl charging activity in patient fibroblasts is reduced by about 30&#x2013;50% compared to healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In one study, the reduced charging activity in fibroblasts from patients with <italic>EPRS1</italic> variants was due to reduced amount of enzyme, as well as reduced specific charging activity of recombinant protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The decrease in cellular RARS1 protein ranged from barely discernable by immunoblot to ~80% in patients with <italic>RARS1</italic> variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In most cases, decreased specific charging activities are attributable to variants in or near catalytic or tRNA-binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, the specific mechanism underlying reduced variant aaRS expression has not yet been elucidated.</p>
      <p id="Par5">We have identified a homozygous c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; p.Pro1482Thr missense single nucleotide variant (SNV, rs930995541) in <italic>EPRS1</italic> in two siblings presenting with clinical features consistent with childhood-onset HLD15 (OMIM 617951). Here, we show the variant reduces EPRS1 expression in patient cells by inhibiting m<sup>6</sup>A modification of requisite mRNA target sites. Unexpectedly, the variant does not alter m<sup>6</sup>A site sequence, as observed for other disease-associated genetic variants, but instead masks accessibility of variant-distal mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A sites. Importantly, bioinformatic analysis suggests widespread disease-associated SNVs that also influence distal m<sup>6</sup>A site accessibility, and a novel etiologic principle of genetic disease with potential for personalized, RNA-based therapeutics.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of siblings with global developmental delay and neurological impairment</title>
        <p id="Par6">Two siblings born to healthy consanguineous parents of Pakistani descent were evaluated in the Neurogenetics Clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The Proband, Sibling 1, is an 18-year-old male with severe global developmental delays and intellectual disability, ataxia, microcephaly, rotatory nystagmus, axial hypotonia, and progressive bilateral lower limb spasticity on serial neurological examinations. At 18 years, he was fully dependent on a wheelchair for ambulation, and his cognitive function was estimated to be at the level of a 2-year-old. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at 2 and 9 years showed microcephaly with diffuse supratentorial and infratentorial volume loss, thinning of the corpus callosum, and global hypomyelination with progressive myelin loss (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The proband&#x2019;s sister, Sibling 2, exhibited similar clinical features. At 16 years, her primary mode of ambulation was a wheelchair, but she could use a walker on level ground. She was less severely affected cognitively, but like her brother was completely dependent for all activities of daily living. At age 15 she became non-ambulatory and was also diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency for which she is treated with levonorgestrel-ethinyl estradiol. MRI of the brain at 3 and 8 years showed microcephaly and global hypomyelination with progressive myelin loss similar to Sibling 1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Further clinical details are available in Supplementary Tables&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Clinical, quad-based exome sequencing of the proband and Sibling 2 revealed homozygosity for a novel missense variant in the gene <italic>EPRS1</italic> [NM_004446.2: c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; p.(Pro1482Thr)]. Both parents and their unaffected son are heterozygous for this variant, and no alternative diagnosis was identified by whole-exome sequencing. Immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were generated from affected siblings, carrier parents, and unrelated controls, transformed with Epstein-Barr virus, and the <italic>EPRS1</italic> variant was validated by Sanger sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Clinical and genetic characterization of siblings with HLD.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Family pedigree; arrow indicates proband. <bold>b</bold> Top row (Sibling 1 at 2&#x2009;yr 4&#x2009;mo): Sagittal T1 image (1) shows a thin, myelin-mature (arrow) corpus callosum (CC).

Cellular ProRS and GluRS charging activities by LCLs from affected siblings were about 20% of unaffected controls; carrier parent LCLs exhibited intermediate activities (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, left and middle panels). tRNA charging of [<sup>14</sup>C]Phe by FARS1 was comparable for all LCLs, indicating specificity of the inhibition of ProRS and GluRS charging (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, right panel). Reduced cellular ProRS and GluRS activities might reflect either decreased amount of EPRS1<sup>Pro1482Thr</sup> or reduced specific charging activity. To test the latter mechanism, recombinant N-terminal, FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) and Pro1482Thr mutant EPRS1 were expressed and purified from HEK293F cells. Specific ProRS and GluRS charging activities were determined in vitro as incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C]Pro and [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu, respectively, into yeast tRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Specific activities of both catalytic domains were identical in WT and mutant EPRS1 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). EPRS1 forms functional dimers via ProRS domain interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS), comparing wild-type and Pro1482Thr mutant ProRS dimers, revealed only minor structural differences in the catalytic and anticodon-binding domains, but somewhat larger differences in the zinc-binding domains in monomer A (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). Both simulated zinc-binding domains were shifted compared to the crystal structure. Pro1482 terminates a &#x3B2;-sheet, and Thr substitution does not perceptibly alter the conformation of this secondary structure (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). Likewise, localization of key elements within the monomer B structure, i.e., ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, proline substrate, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions are not markedly altered (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). These results suggest that diminished ProRS charging activity observed in sibling LCLs is not due to reduced specific activity but implicates differences in EPRS1 level.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Dual post-transcriptional mechanisms dictate reduced expression of Pro1482Thr EPRS1 in siblings with HLD.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Domain structure of EPRS1 including ProRS sub-domains and Pro1482Thr substitution site (top).

        <p id="Par8">EPRS1 amount in LCL lysates was determined by immunoblot using antibody targeting the linker region. EPRS1 levels in the siblings was ~20% of that in unrelated controls bearing WT <italic>EPRS1</italic>; the carrier parents exhibited ~50&#x2013;60% of control levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Importantly, <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA expression was not significantly different in control, parent, and sibling LCLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Similarly, 3&#x2032;-RACE analysis of <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA in LCLs, from the next-to-last exon to the poly-A tail, and spanning the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant in the terminal exon, revealed identical splicing and polyadenylation (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b, c</xref>). These results indicate post-transcriptional regulation is responsible for reduced expression of sibling EPRS1. In view of the essential role of aaRSs in protein synthesis, the effect of the ~80% decrease in EPRS1 amount on global protein synthesis in LCLs from the siblings was determined by polysome profiling. Polysome profiles comparing protein synthesis in LCLs from the female sibling to the mother (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, left) and male sibling to the father (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>, right) are virtually identical. Likewise, metabolic labeling with [<sup>35</sup>S]Cys/Met confirmed that global protein synthesis, as shown by labeling nascent protein, is not reduced in sibling LCLs indicating an ~80% inhibition of EPRS1 expression is not injurious to cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>), and consistent with undiminished specific activity of the EPRS<sup>P1482T</sup> variant.</p>
        <p id="Par9">The fate and function of EPRS1 protein could be influenced by its dimerization status, as well as by localization outside the MSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Size fractionation of recombinant WT and Pro1482Thr ProRS showed similar extents of dimerization (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). To determine the influence of the EPRS1<sup>P1482T</sup> substitution on residence in the MSC, FLAG-tagged, full-length WT and mutant <italic>EPRS1</italic> cDNAs were transfected into HEK293T cells. EPRS1 was isolated from lysates with anti-FLAG resin, eluted with FLAG peptide, and subjected to immunoblot. WT and EPRS1<sup>P1482T</sup> bind equally to the MSC constituents tested, indicating normal MSC incorporation of the mutant (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). The stability of mutant EPRS1 was investigated directly. LCLs were treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, and EPRS1 disappearance monitored by immunoblot. No loss was detected over a 24-h period in any LCL, indicating all EPRS1 forms are highly stable (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). The translation state of WT and variant <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA was explored by polysome profiling. An ~40% reduction in polysomal <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA was observed in affected sibling LCLs, consistent with an important contribution of translation to reduced EPRS1 expression (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>); however, the amount of reduction is less than that of the steady-state level of protein, suggesting additional mechanisms might be operative. A possible defect in nuclear export of newly transcribed c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA was explored by fractionation of LCL lysates into nuclear and cytoplasmic pools. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA, as measured by primer/probe spanning the exon 3&#x2013;4 junction, was ~2-fold higher in siblings compared to controls, and the parental level was intermediate, consistent with higher nuclear levels of c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA and diminished export (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref>).

        <p id="Par10">To investigate the mechanism underlying low expression of variant EPRS1, chimeric reporters were generated containing hRLuc upstream of the 3&#x2019;-terminal region of EPRS1 mRNA surrounding the variant site, namely, exons 31 and 32, bearing either WT or c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A sites (hRLuc-EE) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, left-top). In all reporters, the EPRS1 RNA sequence was in-frame with hRLuc, and without an intervening stop codon. Following transfection into HEK293T cells, expression of the hRLuc-EE reporter bearing the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant was ~25% less than the WT&#x2014;a lower level of inhibition than observed for endogenous <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, right). Because splicing facilitates nuclear mRNA export in mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we generated a reporter pair containing the intervening intron, I31 (hRLuc-EIE) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, left-middle). Inclusion of the intron induced a 50% decrease in expression of the reporter bearing the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant. A similar result was observed following transfection into control LCLs, indicative of a cell type-independent effect of the variant (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Introduction of a second upstream intron between exons 30 and 31 (hRLuc-E-RBGI-EIE, rabbit &#x3B2;-globin gene intron was used because the ~3&#x2009;kb <italic>EPRS1</italic> intron 30 contains a potential insertion sequence/transposon element with multiple inverted repeats) did not further reduce relative expression of the reporter bearing the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). To determine if sequences within the intervening intron influence expression, I31 was replaced by an unrelated chimeric intron, cI (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Although expression of the non-mutated reporter was reduced, expression of hRLuc-EcIE and hRLuc-E-RBGI-EcIE reporters bearing the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant was inhibited to the same extent as reporters containing I31, i.e., hRLuc-EIE. An intron (e.g., cI) in the 5&#x2019;UTR of hRLuc-EE reporter (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>, left, top two schematics), does not synergize with the HLD-causing c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>, right).

In the context of the WT C4444 sequence, simultaneous disruption of the 16727 and 16728 sites (thus permitting modification of the 16726 site only) almost completely blocked hRLuc expression, but mutation of the other pairs, 16726/16728 and 16726/16727, did not reduce expression (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Virtually identical results were observed in the U87-MG glioblastoma cell line (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9a</xref>). This result indicates that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of either 16727 or 16728, the sites flanking the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A site, are sufficient to induce hRLuc expression, but mutation of both sites prevents expression. Similar results in 293&#x2009;T and U87-MG cells indicate the mechanism is cell type-independent. The role of the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant in m<sup>6</sup>A modification was directly assessed by methylated RNA-immunoprecipitation (meRIP) in which the DRACH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> hRLuc reporter was transfected into HEK293T cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-m<sup>6</sup>A antibody, followed by RT-qPCR using primers for hRLuc. Elimination of both 16727 and 16728 sites reduced m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the DRACH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> hRLuc reporter in HEK293T cells and in U87-MG cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9b</xref>). Additionally, mutation of the C4444 site inhibited m<sup>6</sup>A modification to about the same extent as m<sup>6</sup>A site mutation.

In a meRIP-qPCR approach, anti-m<sup>6</sup>A antibody pulldown of c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA was reduced by ~75% compared to controls, confirming reduced m<sup>6</sup>A modification of endogenous <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

        <title>Reduced m<sup>6</sup>A site availability in predicted c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant-specific mRNA structure</title>
        <p id="Par16">mRNAs can exhibit partially unfolded RNA structures during translation, and m<sup>6</sup>A modification can impact coding sequence structure and translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. As local RNA structure can impact m<sup>6</sup>A modification, we propose that the conformation of WT <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA permits m<sup>6</sup>A modification in terminal exons 31-32, but C-to-A substitution at nucleotide 4444 induces a conformational switch that reduces or prevents modification. Minimum energy folding (RNAStructure 6.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>) of the local WT sequence, i.e., exon 31 and exon 32 up to the stop codon without the intervening intron, indicates C4444 is in a 5-bp stem including four sequential G-C base pairs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, top); inclusion of the intron does not alter the folding structure in this region. The stem potentially facilitates a conformation in which the critical modified adenosine residues (16727, 16728) are unpaired within loop structures, consistent with susceptibility to m<sup>6</sup>A modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The folding analysis indicates the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant disturbs the 5-bp stem, and the alternative structure is stabilized by two separate stems encompassing the m<sup>6</sup>A sites surrounding the variant site (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, bottom). The critical adenosine residues are within the base-paired stems, and thus less susceptible to m<sup>6</sup>A modification by the METTL3 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. The role of the 5-bp stem on reporter expression was explored by mutagenesis in the DRACH<sup>&#x2013;</sup> hRLuc background. Mutation of C4444 to A, i.e., generation of the patients&#x2019; variant, reduced hRLuc expression by about half, but restoration of the predicted stem by G4347U mutation in the opposing strand to generate an A-U base pair restored reporter expression (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Mutation of G4347 to non-complementary nucleotides C or A did not restore reporter activity, supporting the predicted local structure and the critical role of the 5-bp stem. The complementary mutations retained the amino acids encoded by the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A (p.Pro1482Thr) reporter, indicating that amino acid sequence in the HLD variant is not responsible for the reduced expression. Three stem G-C pairs were reversed to C-G (including one encompassing the variant), one also was exchanged for an A-U pair, and all exhibited near-WT reporter activity, providing further evidence for the predicted stem (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). The 5-bp stem is highly conserved in placental mammals providing evolutionary evidence for the importance of the 5-bp stem (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>, top). Two wobble base cytosines (for isoleucine and proline) in G-C bps appear as uridine in several mammals, e.g., mice, maintaining a G-U bp, consistent with a significant role of the stem. Interestingly, unlike the Pro1482 codon in one strand of the proposed stem, other proline codons in the window exhibit a different wobble base and higher degeneracy. Formation of the stem is a relatively recent event as it is not conserved in most other vertebrates, except in some reptilia (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>, bottom).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Identification of m<sup>6</sup>A sites defective in hRLuc reporter bearing c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant in <italic>EPRS1</italic> c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A mRNA.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Folding model of exons 31 and 32 of WT (top) and C4444A variant (bottom) <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA.

        <p id="Par17">In an orthogonal approach, masking of the m<sup>6</sup>A sites by the putative stems in the variant mRNA was tested by mutations designed to disrupt the stems and expose cryptic m<sup>6</sup>A sites. Disruption of the stem surrounding the 16727 m<sup>6</sup>A site, by a series of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations (Gln1444Ile, Ile1445Gln, and Pro1446Pro) that minimally altered primary protein sequence, restored expression of the reporter bearing the C4444A mutation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Likewise, mutation of residues in the stem surrounding the 16728 m<sup>6</sup>A site (Ile1451Ile and Ile1481His), restored, and possibly exacerbated, reporter expression. These results are consistent with the previous finding that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a single site is sufficient for EPRS1 expression. Together, the effects of the mutations suggest a mechanism in which the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant reduces accessibility of the m<sup>6</sup>A site to the methyltransferase, and putatively, RNA structure, not linear sequence, is the critical determinant of reporter expression.</p>
        <p id="Par18">The terminal two exons in <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA contains thirteen DRACH sequences, including three potential polymethylated regions in which multiple m<sup>6</sup>A sites are within a&#x2009;~&#x2009;20 to 25-nt window, each including site 16728, 16727, or 16726 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11a</xref>). Site-specific alteration of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in patient LCLs compared to control LCLs was interrogated in twelve DRACH sequences in this region by SELECT-qPCR (single-base elongation- and ligation-based qPCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In this method, the extension and ligation steps joining antisense probes flanking an adenosine residue are hindered by <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methylation of the residue, resulting in reduced amounts of linked template from modified substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Subsequent qPCR amplification, with primers complementary to terminal adapter sequences of the ligated probe-pair template identical for all sites, reveals altered methylation at target base. SELECT-qPCR revealed hypomethylated DRACH sites in the terminal exons of <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA in patient LCLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b</xref>). Specifically, methylation at sites 16728 (A4355) and 16727 (A4464) in patient LCLs were lower by ~58% and ~29%, respectively (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, 1st and 2nd panels), whereas methylation at site 16726 (A4690) was unaltered (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, 3rd panel). As a control, m<sup>6</sup>A methylation at a validated site on 28S rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> was unaffected in patients LCLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, 4th panel). As additional controls, SELECT-qPCR targeted at non-DRACH adenosine residues near sites 16728 and 16726, i.e., A4349 and A4469, respectively, ruled out altered probe-pair accessibility in denatured template RNAs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, 5th and 6th panels). <italic>EPRS1, GAPDH</italic>, and <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA input levels were similar in control and patient LCLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, 7th panel and Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11b</xref>, bottom, right-most 2 panels). An ~40% reduction in methylation was observed at A4704 and A4716 near the terminus of the <italic>EPRS1</italic> 3&#x2019;UTR. Hypomethylation at A4614 and A4666 in patient LCLs was not statistically significant due to large variation in the control LCLs. Modest hypermethylation at A4404 was seen in patient cells. We failed to detect a specific SELECT-qPCR signal at the terminal (13th site) in <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA owing to its proximity to the poly-A site, and consequently a low specificity poly-T up-probe that resulted in a multi-species melt-curve upon qPCR (sequences provided in Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par19">To verify target specificity of relevant probe-pairs SELECT-qPCR was performed on total RNA isolated from control LCLs subjected to <italic>EPRS1</italic> knockdown (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12a, b</xref>). Higher C<sub>t</sub> in <italic>EPRS1</italic> knockdown cells compared to LCLs nucleofected with non-targeting (NT) siRNA suggested probe-pair specificity, with the single exception of site A4614 which again exhibited substantial signal variation between controls. To further validate m<sup>6</sup>A methylation at specific adenosines, total RNA from FTO demethylase-treated control LCLs was subjected to SELECT-qPCR and compared to RNAs pre-quenched with EDTA to inactivate FTO. FTO treatment decreased C<sub>t</sub>, validating SELECT-qPCR signals at m<sup>6</sup>A modification-specific <italic>EPRS1</italic> sites, as well as in the 28S rRNA methylation control; as expected, the signal at non-DRACH control site A4349 was not inhibited by EDTA (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a, b</xref>). Hypomethylation of sites 16728 and 16727, but not 16726, corroborated the reporter and MeRIP-RT-qPCR assays. In view of the unexpected reduction of methylation at sites A4704 and A4716 in the 3&#x2019;UTR, we investigated the role of these sites in expression of the <italic>EPRS1</italic> WT reporter (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a</xref>). As before simultaneous disruption of the 16728 and 16727 sites (corresponding to A4355/A4464) abrogated reporter activity; however, mutation of the A4704/A4716 pair was without effect (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14b</xref>). Together these results suggest that C4444A-directed alteration of RNA structure at sites 16728 and 16727 are sufficient to induce the observed change in EPRS1 expression.</p>

Increased protein expression was not accompanied by increased <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15c</xref>). The influence of forced m<sup>6</sup>A modification at the 16726 site on EPRS1 expression was unexpected. Possibly, binding of m<sup>6</sup>A readers at sites distinct from the CDS sites near 16727/8 is induced. Although site 16726 modification state is not altered by C4444A mutation in the siblings, forced modification remains a viable therapeutic target.</p>
        <p id="Par22">To further verify that simultaneous disruption of methylation at sites 16728 and 16727 accounts for the observed reduction of EPRS1 expression, we explored the effect of site-specific demethylation.

Guiding the demethylase to either site 16728 or 16727 did not reduce EPRS1 expression, but when targeted together decreased EPRS1 levels by about 50%&#x2014;reaching 70&#x2013;80% in several replicates (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16b</xref>), close to the ~75% decrease in EPRS1 expression in sibling LCLs shown above.</p>

        <title>Widespread m<sup>6</sup>A site-distal single-nucleotide variants predicted to alter DRACH site accessibility</title>
        <p id="Par23">The prospect of additional single-nucleotide variants (SNV) that bury or expose distal DRACH sites through altered base-pairing in local RNA structure was investigated. SNVs in the ClinVar database of health status-associated genomic variations were cross-referenced with validated m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the RMVar database of RNA base modifications for all NCBI Refseq transcripts. Analysis was confined to the neighborhood of the CDS-terminal hotspot region for m<sup>6</sup>A modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, by using 100 nucleotides of the 3&#x2019;UTR following the stop-codon, and the preceding up to 150 nucleotides restricted to the last two exons in the coding region. Energy-minimized, predicted secondary structures of the wild-type and ClinVar SNV-containing mRNAs were calculated with RNAfold, and changes in predicted base-pairing at DRACH sites were determined. 117 hits in 54 genes and 87 ClinVar SNVs were identified as candidate m<sup>6</sup>A-distal (m<sup>6</sup>Ad) SNVs (Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and index.html file in Supplementary Information); notably, multiple ClinVar SNVs can alter m<sup>6</sup>A-site accessibility of a given gene, while multiple but not all transcripts of a gene can be affected by a single ClinVar SNV. Notably, the EPRS1 c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A; p.Pro1482Thr missense SNV (rs930995541) is absent from ClinVar database, and therefore not included in the list of predicted m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs. Importantly, twenty candidates encompassing 11 genes and 14 ClinVar SNVs were from synonymous m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs, potentially representing a new class of silent mutations that can alter gene expression and pathogenicity by altering m<sup>6</sup>A-site accessibility. DRACH-motif nucleotide base-pairing was scored as a measure of m<sup>6</sup>A site-accessibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. As one example, a m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV in Von Hippel-Lindau mRNA (<italic>VHL</italic>, ClinVar ID 2224) is predicted to free two DRACH sites base-paired in the reference mRNA, and block accessibility of a third site (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Similarly, a m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV in tuberous sclerosis complex 2 mRNA (<italic>TSC2</italic>, ClinVar ID 468159) predicts increased availability of three DRACH sites base-paired in the reference mRNA (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). PANTHER gene ontology analysis (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a</xref>), and DAVID functional annotation clustering of genes predicted to contain m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs, reveal that these SNVs might impinge on critical biological processes and pathways, such as heart development and DNA damage (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17b</xref>). These newly predicted m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs, by altering accessibility of the methyltransferase to distant m<sup>6</sup>A sites, contrast with the established direct-acting m<sup>6</sup>A-SNPs that alter DRACH or near-DRACH sequences to inactivate existing m<sup>6</sup>A sites or generate new ones, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Importantly, as we have shown for the HLD-causing m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV in <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA, pathologies induced by the newly revealed m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs might be correctible by RNA-based therapeutics.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>Predicted changes in base-pairing of m<sup>6</sup>A-sites driven by health status-associated single nucleotide variants (SNVs).</title><p>RNAfold analysis of a selected 250-nt RNA sequence (see Methods for details) in <italic>VHL</italic> (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>TSC2</italic> (<bold>b</bold>) transcripts, without (left) or with (right) a ClinVar-curated SNV.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par24">There is emerging interest in the role of mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification in human pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. In some cases, the expression of an enzyme constituent of the m<sup>6</sup>A-modification pathway is altered. For example, FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) the major m<sup>6</sup>A eraser, i.e., demethylase, is highly expressed in multiple acute myeloid leukemias, thereby enhancing oncogene-mediated cell transformation and leukemogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Pathogenic genetic variants that perturb m<sup>6</sup>A modification have been identified in two categories: (1) variants in m<sup>6</sup>A pathway enzymes, i.e., in writers, readers, and erasers, or (2) variants in DRACH or near-DRACH sequences themselves. In the first category, homozygous variants in the m<sup>6</sup>A reader <italic>YTHDC2</italic> in three women are associated with early-onset primary ovarian insufficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, a clinical feature also seen in Sibling 2 in our study. Also, a pathogenic variant in FTO has been described in multiple members of a consanguineous Palestinian Arab family responsible for an autosomal-recessive lethal syndrome, and death before 30 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. The variant inactivated DNA demethylation activity, but possibly demethylation of m<sup>6</sup>-modified mRNA was also inactive. The second category has received substantial recent attention in the form of SNPs inducing gain- or loss-of-function mutation of m<sup>6</sup>A sites, termed m<sup>6</sup>A-SNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Two variants that generate pathologic m<sup>6</sup>A sites have been reported, both involving tumor suppressors. A G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant of the tumor suppressor p53 introduces an Arg273His missense substitution that promotes m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the mutant codon and increases expression, possibly by enhanced pre-mRNA splicing; the variant exhibits enhanced drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. In a second study, a G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant of <italic>ANKLE1</italic>, a suppressor of colorectal cancer (CRC), induced m<sup>6</sup>A modification, increasing ANKLE1 expression and reducing CRC risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Several disease-associated m<sup>6</sup>A-SNPs that repress methylation have been identified by combined analysis of GWAS and eQTL data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. For example, a SNP in acyl&#x2010;CoA synthetase medium chain family member 5 (<italic>ACSM5</italic>), a candidate gene for thyroid cancer, reduces m<sup>6</sup>A modification and ACSM5 expression in thyroid cancer tissues, and is associated with the poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par25">Our experiments reveal a third category of pathogenic genetic variants affecting m<sup>6</sup>A modification. In this case, the variant does not disrupt the target adenosine residue, nor the surrounding consensus sequence, but rather is located distal to the DRACH site (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We have observed that optimal expression of wild-type EPRS1 requires mRNA conformation-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Moreover, mutagenesis experiments indicate a requirement of an intact 5-bp putative stem bridging exons 31 and 32 for optimal methylation and gene expression. Importantly, the patient SNV at C4444 is centrally located in the 5-bp stem, thereby disrupting it and reducing modification at distant m<sup>6</sup>A sites, likely by a cis-allosteric alteration of mRNA conformation that reduces accessibility of otherwise modifiable m<sup>6</sup>A sites. This mechanism is supported by the finding that non-catalytic PMOs targeting the regions surrounding the inaccessible m<sup>6</sup>A sites in variant mRNA increase EPRS1 expression and mRNA methylation, likely by increasing accessibility to the methyltransferase and restoring gene expression. Upon probing differential m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in cells from patients and control subjects, hypomethylation in four DRACH sequences in the last two exons of EPRS1 was observed - two C4444A flanking sites in the CDS and two in the 3&#x2019;UTR. Multiple lines of evidence, including reporter-based DRACH site mutagenesis assays, MeRIP-RT-qPCR, reporter-based DRACH-site unmasking assays, and site-targeted demethylation, supported the finding that loss of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation at sites 16728 (A4355) and 16727 (A4464) is sufficient to reduce EPRS1 expression in patient cells by regulating mRNA export and translation. Dual functions of polymethylated m<sup>6</sup>A regions have been described. For example, the ~250 nucleotide coding region instability determinant (CRD) in the <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA CDS, containing polymethylated m<sup>6</sup>A regions in its sequence, binds IGF2BP1 and regulates both mRNA translation and stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Our results suggest a structural polymethylated region formed by the <italic>EPRS1</italic> CDS 3&#x2019;-end, containing non-contiguous sites 16728 and 16727, that is disrupted by SNV C4444A. The unexpected observation that two 3&#x2019;UTR sites, A4704 and A4716, are also hypomethylated in patient LCLs, is intriguing. Pairwise mutation of these residues does not phenocopy the reduced EPRS1 reporter expression observed with the 16728/16727 pair. Possibly, hypomethylation of these sites, although not etiological, is related to loss of EPRS1 expression itself. For example, EPRS1 (misannotated as glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase owing to cDNA sequence similarity) was shown to bind its own 3&#x2019;UTR, but not the upstream CDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. It remains to be determined if loss of EPRS1 alters m<sup>6</sup>A modification of 3&#x2019;UTR DRACH sites. Finally, although the C4444A variant described here is non-synonymous, the altered amino acid sequence does not appear to be critical for the observed regulation of EPRS1 expression. This is supported by examples where synonymous variants are etiologic agents of disease, e.g., cancer-derived synonymous point mutations in <italic>p53</italic> mRNA reduce p53 activity through post-transcriptional control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Similarly, synonymous variants might be found that alter distant m<sup>6</sup>A modification in a structure-dependent manner, thereby providing an additional mechanism by which synonymous mutations dictate functional consequences beyond altering mRNA splicing, transcription and translation factor binding, mRNA stability, and translation elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Schematic of defective processing of <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA bearing c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant.</title><p>Processing of wild-type (top) and C4444A HLD variant <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA (bottom).

      <p id="Par26">Also notable is the finding that the SNV in the open reading frame of <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA reduces both nuclear export and translation in patient LCLs, resulting in pathologically low levels of EPRS1 protein. The requirement for m<sup>6</sup>A modification of wild-type <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA for efficient expression of protein was not previously reported for any aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Moreover, EPRS1 is a constitutive, housekeeping protein, and mRNAs encoding such proteins, for example, ribosomal proteins, generally are de-enriched in m<sup>6</sup>A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In addition to defective m<sup>6</sup>A modification of mutant <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA in patient-derived LCLs, defective m<sup>6</sup>A modification was observed in mutation-bearing reporters in embryonic kidney-derived HEK293T cells and glioma-derived U87-MG cells. The apparent lack of cell-type specificity is consistent with previous observations by others that m<sup>6</sup>A sites are generally constitutive with similar distributions in tissues and cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, m<sup>6</sup>A enzymes, including writers and readers are present in most tissues including major brain cells, such as neurons and neuroglia, the cell types likely to be adversely affected by dysregulated expression in HLD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Importantly, the m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptome is implicated in oligodendrocyte maturation, CNS myelination, and brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par27">Four other patients with distinct bi-allelic pathogenic variants in <italic>EPRS1</italic> exhibiting childhood-onset HLD15 have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Two are homozygous for missense variants in the ProRS catalytic core domain; the other two are compound heterozygous, characterized by one allele with a missense variant in the ProRS catalytic core and a premature stop codon in the other allele. The best studied of these mutant forms is the c.3344&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G variant which encodes a p.Pro1115Arg substitution in the catalytic core domain predicted to influence specific activity. Indeed, an ~30% decrease in charging activity by recombinant ProRS was shown as well as a 40% decrease in EPRS1 protein in patient fibroblasts. In vitro charging activity in lymphoblast lysates was determined in one of the patients and showed ~70% reduction compared to controls. These results, combined with our own, suggest a mechanism in which diminished total charging activity&#x2014;whether due to protein amount or specific activity, or both&#x2014;contributes to the pathologic defect.</p>
      <p id="Par28">The mechanistic link between reduced EPRS1 and CNS hypomyelination remains elusive. The obligate role of EPRS1, like all aaRSs, in interpretation of the genetic code during translation suggests that reduced protein synthesis is a major contributor to pathology. The undiminished total protein synthesis in our patients&#x2019; LCLs argues against this mechanism. However, low levels of EPRS1 might specifically inhibit protein synthesis in critical cells particularly sensitive to tRNA charging activity, e.g., in myelinating oligodendrocytes. Consistent with tissue&#x2010;selective responses to aminoacylation defects, fibroblasts from patients with compound heterozygous mutations in the GluRS region of EPRS1 exhibited normal growth rates despite severely compromised tRNA charging activity of recombinant protein in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Although genetic defects in two other cytosolic aaRSs, namely, DARS1 and RARS1, also cause HLD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, defects in at least ten cytosolic aaRSs cause distinct neurologic disorders including encephalopathy, microcephaly, as well as peripheral neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, suggesting that aaRS inhibition of protein synthesis is unlikely to be the principal etiology underlying HLD. Alternatively, the defect might be due a defective noncanonical function of EPRS1, possibly a CNS-specific function, unrelated to protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. This mechanism would suggest that disease-causing variants in other aaRSs inhibit the same or related noncanonical activities&#x2014;a concept not supported by current data. A possible clue is the observation that three of the variant genes that cause HLD, i.e., <italic>EPRS1</italic>, <italic>DARS1</italic>, and <italic>RARS1</italic>, encode constituents of the MSC which houses nine of the twenty cytosolic aaRSs. In addition, variants in two non-aaRS MSC constituents, i.e., <italic>AIMP1</italic> and <italic>AIMP2</italic>, also cause leukodystrophy, although this is likely to be secondary to a primary neurodegenerative process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. Thus, a dysfunctional MSC might contribute to HLD pathology. However; elucidation of this mechanism is hampered by the current lack of understanding of the critical function(s) of the MSC which appears to be unrelated to efficiency of protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of leukodystrophies, aided by state-of-the-art molecular technologies, has begun to guide potential therapeutic approaches, including drug design and gene therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup>. For example, an RNA-based therapeutic targeting proteolipid protein 1 (<italic>PLP1</italic>), the gene defective in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), has been investigated. Administration of antisense oligonucleotides targeting <italic>PLP1</italic> restored myelination and motor function in the jimpy (Plp1(jp)) mouse model of severe PMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup>. Likewise, a morpholino was used to correct aberrant splicing in a mouse bearing a <italic>PLP1</italic> exon 3 variant that in humans causes PMD, spastic paraplegia 2, and hypomyelination of early myelinating structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>. Lastly, administration of a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide targeting N-acetyltransferase 8-like (Nat8l), the enzyme that generates N-acetyl-L-aspartate, reverses ataxia in a mouse model of Canavan disease, a vacuolar leukodystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup>. In the experiments described here, the mechanism of inhibition has significant implications regarding potential treatment to restore <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA processing. Diminished expression of the variant EPRS1 results from a single well-defined molecular event that suppresses both nuclear export and translation, namely, defective m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the transcript. Increasing gene expression using an antisense strategy against the coding sequence has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref></sup>. Rationally-designed, antisense PMOs were deployed to disrupt the predicted, variant-specific RNA secondary structure to reveal masked m<sup>6</sup>A sites. The modest rescue serves as a proof-of-principle for pre-clinical testing in animal models and, potentially, in eventual therapeutic application. Antisense PMOs, e.g., eteplirsen and golodirsen, are FDA-approved for clinical management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref></sup> by altering splicing of mutant mRNA. Alternatively, tethering catalytically-inactive dCas13 to m<sup>6</sup>A writers, erasers, and readers for programmable, site-specific introduction of m<sup>6</sup>A has the potential to transform fundamental studies of RNA methylation, as well as clinical application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of a targeted RNA methylation system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, nucleus-localized dCas13b fused with truncated METTL3 methyltransferase was co-nucleofected with guide RNAs cognate to sites upstream of m<sup>6</sup>A sites in the two terminal exons of <italic>EPRS1</italic> mRNA. Highly effective restoration of EPRS1 expression in patient LCLs expands the therapeutic toolkit to ameliorate low EPRS1 expression associated with the c.4444&#x2009;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A variant.</p>
      <p id="Par30">RNA structural determinants of m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites have been proposed but a consensus structure is yet to be identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref></sup>; however, consensus sequences sequestered within RNA duplexes are known to be poor substrates for m<sup>6</sup>A modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref></sup>. The discovery of a SNV that allosterically blocks accessibility of distal RNA m<sup>6</sup>A sites, with subsequent altered protein expression, reveals a novel disease etiology: m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNPs or -SNVs represent a third mechanism by which SNPs (or SNVs) alter m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent gene expression, in addition to SNPs dysregulating genes encoding m<sup>6</sup>A pathway proteins or within m<sup>6</sup>A-sites (m<sup>6</sup>A-SNPs) themselves. Genome-wide, bioinformatic prediction of a host of m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs suggests this mechanism of disease might be widespread. In most cases, a single m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV alters the accessibility of multiple DRACH target sites within a transcript&#x2014;both by masking existing sites or exposing new ones. Currently there is no experimental evidence that these predicted m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs influence m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the transcript; however, limited biochemical evidence suggests ClinVarID 2224 in <italic>VHL</italic> might increase protein amount in 786-O renal carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref></sup>. Although the <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> variants illustrated here show non-synonymous, hydrophobic amino acid substitutions, many synonymous m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs were predicted. The finding represents an additional mechanism by which silent mutations can influence gene expression and contribute to disease etiology. Validation of predicted m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV-driven changes in RNA structure, m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and gene expression are necessary to show the findings for <italic>EPRS1</italic> can be extended to other genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref></sup>. Analysis of m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV-altered RNA structures might reveal consensus structural determinants of m<sup>6</sup>A modification on mRNA.

        <title>Prediction of m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNVs and gene ontology analysis</title>
        <p id="Par58">The pipeline described here generates a comprehensive software solution implemented in Python<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref></sup> for analysis of variant-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A modifications within the human genome. The software takes as input three distinct files: a FASTA file containing the human genome sequences, a VCF file containing a curated list of variations sourced from the ClinVar database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref></sup> intersected with RMVar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref></sup> to focus on m<sup>6</sup>A modifications only, and a BED file specifying a series of genomic regions of interest. Human genome version GRCh38 was used, and the BED file contains genomic coordinates of protein-coding, whole gene regions with transcripts from NCBI RefSeq extracted from the UCSC Genome Browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par59">Initially, the BED file is processed to extract, for each listed transcript, the genomic coordinates of the last two coding sequence exons, along with up to 100 base pairs of untranslated regions (UTRs) adjacent to the CDS. Once the BED file is processed, the pipeline iterates through the VCF entries with the m<sup>6</sup>A modifications. The occurrence of each modification in the BED file is verified across the regions described above. Upon a positive match, the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding CDS and UTR segments, per the relevant transcript, are retrieved from the input genome FASTA file, yielding a reference sequence. Subsequently, an alternate sequence is generated by applying the modification specified in the VCF entry. The pipeline proceeds by searching for DRACH sites within the reference sequence through a regular expression (DRACH &#x2192; [AGT][AG]AC[ACT]). Modifications overlapping DRACH motifs, causing termination codons or frameshifts, or altering termination codons to sense codons, are rejected. Following these quality filters, we predict the secondary structure of the reference and alternate sequences using ViennaRNA RNAfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref></sup>, with a single constraint that isolated base pairs are not formed.</p>
        <p id="Par60">The primary objective is to assess if m<sup>6</sup>A-distal SNVs affect DRACH site accessibility, specifically by evaluating the alteration of base-pairing of nucleotides within segments of the DRACH motif, i.e., DRA, RAC, ACH, DRAC, RACH, and the entire DRACH. m<sup>6</sup>A-site accessibility, as reflected by DRACH-site base-pairing, was used as a scoring system for ranking the identified targets. The evaluation compares the reference and alternate dot-bracket representation of the folding structures at the DRACH level, with non-overlapping scoring, e.g., in the case of a free DRAC site, the counter of free DRAC sites is incremented, but the same site is not considered for counting free DRA and RAC sites. The final pipeline output is a table that reports filtered m<sup>6</sup>A sites with altered availability, and relevant information, including ClinVar ID, genomic coordinates, strand orientation, associated gene symbol, NCBI RefSeq transcript ID, modification position, minimum free energy (MFE) for reference and alternate structures, &#x2206;MFE (difference between the absolute values of MFEs), a flag reporting whether the modification is synonymous, the total number of DRACH sites in both the reference and alternate structures, and the number of free and paired DRA, RAC, ACH, DRAC, RACH, and DRACH sites in both the reference and alternate structures. The table of predicted m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV candidates is interactive and permits visual inspection of predicted structures rendered with the <italic>forna</italic> JavaScript library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref></sup>, with the length of the reference and m<sup>6</sup>Ad-SNV-containing alternate sequences limited to 250 base pairs. Within this constraint, applied to maintain reliability of the results predicted by RNAfold, the sequence composition contains up to 100 base pairs from 3&#x2019;UTRs, with the remaining base pairs limited to the last two exons.</p>

Both molecular models were prepared for simulation at pH 7.0 by protonating lysine and arginine and deprotonating aspartate and glutamate.

Net protein charge (negative 26) was neutralized by random replacement of 26 water molecules with Na<sup>+</sup>. To simulate a physiological medium of 0.154&#x2009;M NaCl, additional NaCl ion pairs randomly replaced water molecules. The model was relaxed by geometry optimization to remove steric tensions, and a series of short molecular dynamics simulations were done in which protein atoms were initially restrained permitting relaxation the water molecules and free ions. Finally, before the production simulation, a 200&#x2009;ps equilibration simulation was performed to facilitate relaxation of the whole system. The production simulation was performed for 100&#x2009;ns at room temperature (298&#x2009;K) and 1&#x2009;atm.
