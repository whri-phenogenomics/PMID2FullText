      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Enzymatic polysorbate (PS) degradation in biological drug formulations mediated by host cell proteins (HCPs) has become a widespread and acute challenge in the biopharmaceutical industry. As an indispensable surfactant, PS is used in drug formulations to prevent biopharmaceutical agents, often monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), from aggregation and minimizes surface adhesion and air-liquid interfacial stress.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> PS is a heterogeneous mixture consisting of a hydrophilic polyoxyethylene sorbitan head group that is esterified to one or multiple hydrophobic fatty acids of varying length. Degradation of PS is driven via two independent pathways: Chemical degradation by auto-oxidation or hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation elicited by hydrolytic enzymes.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Chemical degradation has been successfully prevented by the use of buffering agents and anti-oxidants,<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x2013;4</xref></sup> leaving hydrolytic enzymes acting on ester bonds (Enzyme class 3.1) as the major root cause of PS degradation. These enzymes are secreted in the bioprocess as HCPs originating from production cell lines derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x2013;8</xref></sup> Here, a small portion of hydrolytic HCPs that are particularly difficult to remove persist in the downstream purification process and eventually cause hydrolytic cleavage of PS in drug substance and drug product. The degradation of PS results in the accumulation of free fatty acid aggregates and associated (sub-)visible particle formation. This can adversely affect product safety and quality because these aggregates can potentially induce adverse immune responses, reduce product efficacy, or compromise its stability. In recent years, substantial effort has been put into the identification and characterization of potential HCPs acting on the ester bonds of PS.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x2013;14</xref></sup> One prominent example is Phospholipase B-Like 2 (PLBL2), which was long considered an active polysorbate-degrading HCP due to misinterpretation of results from contaminated recombinant HCP samples. This example highlights the importance of a well-designed purification and characterization strategy for recombinant HCPs to avoid misleading data interpretation as a result of persisting impurities.<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> As hydrolytic HCPs were found to cause PS degradation at trace levels, &lt;10 ppm,<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> detection of these low-abundance enzymes represents a major analytical challenge for the biopharmaceutical community. Therefore, new innovative analytical methods were developed, including optimized sample preparation prior to mass spectrometric analysis<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x2013;12</xref></sup> and activity-based protein profiling.<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> To date, advances in HCP detection have resulted in a comprehensive list of potentially PS-degrading protein contaminants detected at various stages of the bioprocess, but data regarding their enzymatic activity profiles against PS and an understanding of the impact of the downstream purification processes on these enzymes are still lacking. A less explored but promising approach to address this issue is the recombinant overexpression and simultaneous screening of multiple putative polysorbate-degrading HCPs, especially the hydrolase species.</p>
      <p>Toward this end, we identified, systematically overexpressed and characterized a selected list of potentially critical CHO cell-derived hydrolases, which were previously detected in seven purified model mAb products via a state-of-the-art mass spectrometry approach. We further used a transposase-based expression system in combination with a newly established lipoprotein lipase (LPL) knockout CHO host cell line to generate stable cell pools expressing the candidate hydrolases in high yields, without contamination of LPL and by entailing Streptavidin (Strep)- and Histidine (His)-affinity tags. The latter enabled the implementation of orthogonal purification steps, ensuring high purity of the recombinantly expressed CHO hydrolases. Characterization studies with the purified hydrolases, including cellular localization data, activity testing toward PS degradation and pH activity profiling, were conducted. Finally, by compiling all data, we were able to build a knowledge base that assists in the prioritization and risk assessment of critical CHO cell-derived hydrolases at different points throughout the entire biopharmaceutical production process.</p>

        <p>By means of a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique (down to 0.3 ppm), 7 mAb products were analyzed for their residual hydrolase content. Of note, the analyzed mAb products were industrially relevant molecules that were purified through a chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) bioprocess and were formulated to simulate preparation for clinical application.

        <p>Although all mAb products were expressed using the same CHO expression platform, the number of identified hydrolases in the purified antibody products varied from 1 to 6 of the seven investigated samples. LPL, GNS, and SMPD1 were frequently identified as hydrolases, but others (CES2C, CES1(F), PLD3, IAH1, PAF-AH) were only found in single products. To investigate whether the expression of identified hydrolases correlated with their frequency of occurrence in purified antibodies, we analyzed previously compiled transcriptomics and proteomics data sets of three different, representative cell-line development campaigns (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Overall, a high and statistically significant correlation between transcriptome and proteome data was observed for all three mAb datasets (Suppl. Figure S1). Strikingly, for LPL, a frequently mentioned hydrolase in the context of PS degradation,<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> the high occurrence in many mAb products correlated with high mRNA and protein expression in all investigated production cell lines. This was also true for SMPD1 and LIPA, although here high expression values correlated only with identification in 5 and 3 of the 7 analyzed mAb products, respectively. The hydrolases CES1F and PAF-AH showed high gene and protein expression although it was only found in one of the investigated mAb formulations. The other identified hydrolases were expressed at much lower levels and occurrence of identification was low, except for GNS, which was identified in 6 of 7 products (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In conclusion, expression of hydrolases varies substantially in CHO cells and mRNA and protein expression levels are not sufficiently predictive of the occurrence and abundance of the hydrolase in mAb products, which is probably due to unique interactions of difficult-to-remove hydrolases with the product and/or the chromatography columns.

        <title>Knockout of PS-degrading LPL in CHO cells to allow for unbiased HCP characterizations</title>
        <p>As LPL was most frequently identified in mAb product formulations, expressed at the highest level in CHO production cells and previously suggested as a source for substantial PS degradation,<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> we aimed to investigate the extent of LPL-related PS degradation in our platform process. Therefore, LPL was knocked out (KO) in an mAb-producing CHO cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. A combination of two different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments validated the complete bi-allelic removal of the LPL gene in the engineered production cell line (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The KO production cell line was fed-batch cultivated head-to-head with the respective originator mAb production cell line (expressing LPL) over a period of 14&#x2009;days in an ambr&#xAE;250 bioreactor system. Supernatant sampled on day 3 of the fed-batch process was measured using LPL enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which confirmed the absence of LPL protein in samples of the LPL KO cell line (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Next, supernatant harvested at day 14 of the cultivation process was subjected to a fluorescence micelle assay (FMA) measuring PS20 degradation over time at five different time points post PS spiking (d0, d1, d3, d7, d14) (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Strikingly, in the supernatant of the non-edited parental CHO production clone (LPL wildtype (wt)), 95% of initially spiked PS content was degraded after one day of incubation. In contrast, the supernatant of LPL KO production cells elicited a significantly slower PS degradation rate resulting in only 7% degradation of initial PS levels after one day of incubation and 31% degradation after 14&#x2009;days. While these data suggest a major PS-degrading activity by LPL, the observed residual PS-degrading activity clearly suggests that further hydrolases contribute to the total PS degradation activity. Therefore, an LPL KO cell line would certainly serve as an improved manufacturing host cell line for biologics, but also represents an ideal host cell line to characterize the additionally present hydrolases without the substantially masking PS degradation activity of LPL.

        <title>Secretion analysis of CHO hydrolases</title>
        <p>In order to characterize the additional hydrolases previously identified in mAb products and to analyze their potential PS degradation activity (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the remaining 11 CHO hydrolases were individually overexpressed in a CHO K1 glutamine synthetase (GS) LPL KO host cell line to avoid the masking potential of LPL. Here, the KO was realized via zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) and validated using LPL ELISA (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Native CHO coding sequences of the 11 hydrolases, containing no additional signal sequence, were cloned into a transposon expression plasmid including His- and Strep-Tags at the 3&#x2019;-end of the hydrolase gene (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Next, transposon plasmids were stably introduced in the CHO K1 GS LPL KO host cell line using a transposase technology in combination with a GS-based metabolic selection approach to generate stable hydrolase expressing pools. As many of the identified hydrolases were annotated by UniProt as intracellular proteins, we wondered why potentially intracellular hydrolases were identified in the harvested supernatant and ultimately in the formulated mAb products. To determine whether the hydrolases are actively secreted into the supernatant, their localization in supernatant and cell pellet was quantified via the His-Tag after a three-day batch cultivation of all generated hydrolase overexpressing cell pools that displayed&#x2009;&gt;98% viable cells at harvest (Supplementary Figure S2a). While the hydrolases PAF-AH and SMPD1 were fully secreted by the CHO cells, other proteins, including CES1F, CES2C, GNS, LPLA2, and PPT1, were partially detected in the intracellular fraction. Only LIPA, IAH1, and PLD3 were mainly localized intracellularly (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Other than PLD3, LIPA and IAH1 could be quantified in supernatant of the 3 mAb producer cell lines (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>), which might be due to mAb-HCP shuttling mechanisms or simply a reduced harvest viability of the assayed cell culture (59, 84, 88% for mAb1, 2, 3, respectively). As most of the overexpressed native CHO hydrolases are actively secreted, their occurrence in mAb products is not surprising.

        <title>Hydrolytic activity of CHO hydrolases against polysorbate</title>
        <p>Next, we aimed for a detailed characterization of all overexpressed CHO hydrolases regarding their PS degradation potential. All stable hydrolase-expressing cell pools were cultivated in (fed-) batch mode and supernatants were harvested (Supplementary Figure S2b). The crude supernatant was spiked with PS (0.4&#x2009;mg/mL) and PS degradation was investigated over a period of 14&#x2009;days via FMA. Strong PS degradation activity was measured for hydrolases CES1F, CES2C, PPT1, and PAF-AH (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, moderate PS degradation was elicited by LPLA2, and IAH1, while no PS degradation was observed in supernatants of cell pools overexpressing GNS, SMPD1, LIPA, CES1, and PLD3, which also served as a comparative baseline. Notably, the crude culture supernatant does not allow for the determination of the exact PS degradation activity for each enzyme, as the supernatant likely contained additional hydrolases or lacked hydrolases that are not efficiently secreted. Thus, for direct comparison with uniform starting concentrations, we developed a multi-step purification strategy to obtain highly purified protein. Toward this end, overexpressed proteins were purified from harvested cell culture supernatant or cell pellets using a combination of two orthogonal capture steps comprising an immobilized metal ion affinity column (IMAC) specifically binding the His-Tag on the recombinant hydrolases followed by a Strep-Tactin column to further capture the Strep-tagged hydrolases. In addition, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed as a polishing step and for aggregate removal. After purification, the CHO hydrolases were tested for their catalytic activity toward PS20 via FMA. Contrary to the FMA performed with crude supernatant, purified enzymes were spiked at uniform concentrations in a formulation buffer containing PS20 and PS degradation was investigated over a period of 14&#x2009;days as described before (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast to the previous analysis of crude cell culture supernatant, purified CES1, IAH1, and LIPA now showed strong PS degradation activity. This observation aligns with the fact that these enzymes are not secreted and, as a result, are not present in the crude supernatant (see <xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Strikingly, LPLA2 and PAF-AH now displayed the strongest PS degradation activity among all assayed hydrolases. For CES1F and CES2C, similar PS degradation was observed, while the hydrolase PPT1 now exhibited lower PS degradation activity as a purified enzyme. As before, GNS, SMPD1 and PLD3 displayed no PS degradation potential. Besides the above-mentioned drawbacks when measuring crude cell culture supernatant, it is important to note that the stability or aggregation of purified enzymes can influence the observed activity levels over time. In comparison with other hydrolases, PPT1 was particularly prone to aggregation during the purification process (Supplementary Figure S3).

        <p>These experiments showed that hydrolase-containing crude cell culture supernatant can provide an initial indication of hydrolase-specific PS degradation potential, but purification of specific hydrolases is necessary to determine their specific enzymatic activity. In summary, 8 of 11 hydrolases previously identified in the mAb formulations displayed significant PS degradation activity. Of note, enzyme activity was measured under uniform pH conditions, whereby individual pH optima of the enzymes were not considered.</p>

        <title>Comparison of active sites in the CHO hydrolases</title>
        <p>To identify common features among the identified active hydrolases, we compared the active sites of both PS degrading and non-degrading hydrolases. We determined the active site residues of the CHO hydrolases by referring to UniProt annotations. In addition, we compared the protein sequences to orthologous enzymes with experimentally determined active sites (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A common catalytic triad consisting of a serine (Ser) &#x2013; histidine (His) &#x2013; aspartate/glutamate (Asp/Glu) motif was identified in PS-degrading hydrolases, which distinguished them from non-PS degrading enzymes (<xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="t0002"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Active site residues of hydrolases identified in seven industrial mAb formulations.

        <p>Enzymes with alternative catalytic sites (GNS, PLD3, and SMPD1) did not exhibit PS degradation activity. This finding is particularly valuable when new hydrolases are identified, as it provides a clear marker of potential PS degradation activity. It is important to note that previous research has shown that PS-degrading hydrolases are not limited to the enzyme sub-class of &#x201C;carboxylic ester hydrolases&#x201D; (3.1.1).<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In fact, they can also be found within the broader enzyme class &#x201C;acting on ester bonds&#x201D; (3.1), which includes not only carboxylic-ester hydrolases but also thioester and phosphoester hydrolases, among others. This underscores the diverse enzymatic landscape involved in PS degradation and highlights the importance of the conserved catalytic triad as a predictive marker for PS degradation activity.</p>

        <p>The activity optimum of enzymes is strongly dependent on an ideal pH.<sup><xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> To further characterize and evaluate the pH optima of each identified hydrolase acting on PS, pH screenings with the purified enzymes were conducted (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Here, enzymatic activity was measured upon cleavage of ester bonds in an assay using 4-methylumbelliferyl decanoate (MUD4) as a PS surrogate. LIPA and LPLA2 displayed unique activity profiles with activity optima in a neutral or acidic pH, respectively. In contrast, the group of CES1, CES2C, IAH1, and PAF-AH revealed similar pH-dependent activity patterns with low activity in the low pH range and increasing activity with increasing pH values. Equally, the group of CES1F and PPT1 displayed pH optima at strongly basic pH values, while here activity at lower pH was also relatively high.

        <p>As the investigated hydrolases showed various pH-dependent activity profiles, this property might be harnessed to identify or exclude residual hydrolases in final drug products. To test this hypothesis, the ester cleaving activity of three model mAb formulations was analyzed in the same way as in the above-described pH screenings (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). Varying pH-dependent PS degrading activities were observed, which may indicate the presence of various residual hydrolases with unique pH optima. mAb formulation A showed strong activity toward higher (basic) pH values, but no enzymatic activity under acidic pH conditions. In contrast, mAb formulation B displayed strong similarities to the combined activity profiles of LPLA2 and LIPA. Lastly, mAb formulation C also showed strong activity toward higher pH values. However, unlike mAb A, mAb C revealed a medium activity in the acidic pH range, suggesting the presence of CES1F and/or PPT1. In conclusion, differing pH activity profiles might be used to infer the presence or absence of specific hydrolases and could be a valuable resource when considering pH values of mAb formulation buffers.</p>

        <title>CHO hydrolase risk matrix</title>
        <p>In a final step, gathered data about actively PS-degrading hydrolases were summarized in a risk matrix (<xref rid="f0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), which can serve as a guideline for prioritizing potentially critical HCPs for targeted removal or monitoring during bioprocess development. Based on identified values for gene expression, occurrence in mAb products, cellular localization, and the PS degradation activity, risk points were assigned and ranked in a final score. All risk categories were weighted equally (for rating approach, see Supplementary Table S1). The pH-dependent hydrolase activity was not incorporated into the risk matrix, as this factor is specific to the formulation buffer and must be assessed individually. Of note, proteomic data were not part of the risk matrix, as quantitative proteomic datasets may not be readily available for biopharmaceutical production processes.

        <p>Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate strong correlation between proteome and transcriptome datasets (supported by localization data). As a result of this assessment, top ranked and thus to be prioritized in removal during the bioprocess are the hydrolases LIPA, PPT1, PAF-AH, and LPLA2, which all showed strong PS degradation activity likely catalyzed by the Ser, His, Asp/Glu triad. Among these, LIPA was the only intracellular hydrolase and was also highly expressed on mRNA level, thus rendering this enzyme particularly critical for bioprocesses with low cell viability or high cell lysis at the end of the fermentation and/or during harvest. LPLA2 and PAF-AH both displayed high PS degradation capacity, for PAF-AH in combination with efficient secretion, which rendered it with the higher risk score. IAH1 has the lowest risk score because it combined medium PS activity, intracellular localization and comparably low mRNA expression. This risk matrix can be used as a guideline to focus on the most critical PS-degrading HCPs in a CHO-based manufacturing process and helps to ensure efficient use of resources.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Removal of PS-hydrolyzing HCPs from biologic products has proven challenging to the biopharmaceutical industry, jeopardizing the supply of innovative medicine.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Thus, the identification and characterization of hydrolytic HCPs are crucial for understanding their potential impact on product stability, efficacy, and safety. In this study, we characterized 12 hydrolytic enzymes potentially acting on PS that were identified in seven different mAb preparations. Our results suggest that the presence of specific HCPs in purified mAbs is influenced by factors beyond gene expression levels, which is in line with literature on difficult-to-remove HCPs. Here, final formulation &#x201C;contaminating&#x201D; HCPs are reported to persist purification either via product association or co-elution due to product-resembling physicochemical protein properties.<sup><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32&#x2013;36</xref></sup></p>
      <p>In line with the previous work of Chiu et al., our study highlighted the importance of LPL as a major contributor to PS degradation.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated LPL KO alone was not able to halt PS degradation completely, explaining the increasing efforts put into identification and characterization of additional hydrolytic HCPs.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
      <p>By the systematic overexpression of hydrolytic HCPs other than LPL, we aimed for a system enabling the detailed characterization and, thus, a comprehensive risk assessment, of potentially critical CHO cell-derived HCPs acting on PS. We successfully demonstrated that hydrolase-containing crude cell culture supernatant can be applied in a PS degradation assay, providing strong indications toward hydrolase-specific PS degradation. In fact, only LIPA, IAH1, and CES1 did not confirm the results obtained with the purified hydrolases, which is probably due to their intracellular localization.</p>
      <p>Following hydrolase purification, FMA data confirmed the list of PS-critical HCPs previously identified by several different groups.<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In our study, we observed that the hydrolase SMPD1 was not active against PS, which presents a discrepancy with the findings reported in literature.<sup><xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Kovner et al. demonstrated very weak activity of SMPD1 against PS. However, it is important to consider that this could be attributed to residual HCPs, as only one affinity tag was used to purify hydrolases. In our study, we successfully purified SMPD1 as confirmed by a size exclusion chromatogram and Western blot against the C-terminal His tag (Suppl. Figure S4a). Furthermore, comparison of the separations of a SEC protein standard mixture and SMPD1 shows that the protein elutes according to the apparent molecular weight of the monomer (72 kDa), demonstrating that no aggregation has occurred (Suppl. Figure S4b). To our knowledge, our work is the first to include three orthogonal capture steps for hydrolase purifications and activity data based on a uniform starting concentration, enabling direct comparison of PS degradation rates. Here, we demonstrate varying enzymatic activity for different hydrolases, which explains why enzyme abundance does not consistently correspond to the extent of PS degradation in a drug product.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect is the localization of hydrolytic HCPs, especially in terms of CHO proteins, as localization data are oftentimes not experimentally determined. Low harvest viabilities lead to the release of intracellular HCPs, changing the HCP profile in the cell culture harvest including PS-degrading enzymes.<sup><xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Thus, cell viability at harvest and cell-straining harvest procedures can be of particular importance in products contaminated with predominantly intracellular HCPs.</p>
      <p>Enzymes active against PS were found to possess the classical catalytic triad, which consists of Serine (Ser), Histidine (His), and Aspartate/Glutamate (Asp/Glu). This finding is consistent with the activities of PS hydrolases investigated in previous research.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, acid ceramidase possessing the same catalytic triad does not exhibit PS degrading activity.<sup><xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In contrast to the enzymes investigated here, acid ceramidase belongs to EC number 3.5 and not 3.1. Thus, the catalytic triad is a prerequisite for PS degradation, but other protein properties are similarly important.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we found that purified mAb formulations exhibited varying activity pH profiles, suggesting the involvement of multiple enzymes in PS degradation. This further supports the idea that the specific enzymes, which are active with regard to PS degradation, depend on the downstream purification process and the specific mAb product. Although these data do not conclusively identify a hydrolase active in a drug product, activity pH profiles can help exclude specific enzyme groups and provide information on which group is significantly involved in PS hydrolysis. This information is particularly useful when multiple hydrolases are identified, and it is unclear which of them are primarily involved in PS hydrolysis in a particular product. Furthermore, use of potential preventive strategies, such as changing the pH of a formulation buffer to reduce PS-degrading activity of specific HCPs, may be beneficial. However, it should be considered that pH changes are limited to the stability range of the product and may cause chemical PS degradation in extreme pH conditions.<sup><xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Based on our findings, we developed a risk matrix to prioritize hydrolases for further investigation and potential mitigation strategies. Of note, LPL would most likely have scored the highest in the risk matrix, as it showed highest gene and protein expression values and was found in 6 of 7 mAb products. In addition, LPL wt cell lines strongly degraded PS in comparison to LPL KO cell lines, which is in line with current literature confirming strong PS degradation by LPL.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Strikingly, LIPA, despite being mainly localized intracellularly, is frequently found in mAb preparations and scores the highest final score in the risk matrix. According to our data, approximately 10% of LIPA is secreted or at least found in the cell culture supernatant. Considering its high expression level, it is conceivable that even at low secretion levels, relatively high concentrations of LIPA are reached in the cell culture supernatant comparable to or even higher than that of other PS hydrolases. Additionally, low harvest viabilities or increased cell lysis induced by the harvest method or necrosis might increase the release of intracellular LIPA, offering an easy-to-implement counter measurement. Although the risk matrix provides a guidance of which hydrolases should be more closely monitored in the final drug product, individual products can differ in their hydrolase profile. Therefore, an individual case assessment is necessary, considering also other factors as the pH-dependent activity profiles or the level of similarity toward the specific biopharmaceutical.</p>
      <p>This work provides a valuable overview facilitating decision-making toward future strategies to mitigate PS degradation. Due to the individual inherent features of the identified HCPs, multiple mitigation strategies are conceivable and must/can be combined to develop a PS degradation-free final drug product. Starting with the cell-line development, it was shown, that critical HCPs can be removed completely using genome engineering tools such as zinc finger nucleases or CRISPR/Cas9.<sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Another cell-line engineering approach would be the knockdown of several hydrolases using artificial miRNAs or siRNAs.<sup><xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Given the essentiality of some HCPs for the CHO cell, other methods focused on the two main mechanisms responsible for retaining HCPs during purification: product association or product co-elution.<sup><xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Tackling product association of specific HCPs, the molecule itself could be engineered to prevent specific interactions.<sup><xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> However, this concept is only feasible if the functionality of the product remains intact.<sup><xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> More common is the use of stringent wash buffers during the downstream chromatography steps, which may include extreme pH values and wash additives.<sup><xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> It is important to note that not every wash buffer can be used because some may compromise product quality. In general, HCP removal during purification can be realized by many other methods, such as flocculation,<sup><xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> depth filtration,<sup><xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and various chromatography modes.<sup><xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Of note, industrial bioprocesses are striving for platform processes that mostly do not allow the introduction of additional HCP reduction steps to ensure timely development and reduced complexity. Thus, using our results, it will be possible to optimize and adapt existing purification processes to specifically remove critical HCPs. Finally, PS degradation can be reduced by alternative formulation strategies. Besides changing the pH of the formulation buffer, the addition of hydrolase inhibitors or fatty acid solubilizer were successfully applied to reduce PS degradation and/or particle formation.<sup><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Moreover, alternative surfactants as Poloxamer 188 were effectively used due to their lack of cleavable ester bonds.<sup><xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> However, other than PS20, which has an excellent safety profile, any new formulation ingredient must address toxicology and stability concerns, requiring laborious and time-consuming safety analyses.<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Our system of stably HCP-overexpressing CHO cells enabled the robust supply of HCPs without contamination by the strongly PS-degrading LPL enzyme and facilitates the expansion of this dataset in the future. In conclusion, PS degradation represents a highly relevant problem in the biopharmaceutical industry that can only be solved through joint efforts of all bioprocess-involved departments.</p>

MUD4 is a nonfluorescent ester that, upon cleavage by esterases, releases the fluorescent product 4-methylumbelliferon (MU). This cleavage of the ester bond results in an increase in fluorescence signal within the sample, which can be detected using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355&#x2009;nm and 460&#x2009;nm (Sepctra Max M series, Molecular Devices, San Jos&#xE9;), respectively.
