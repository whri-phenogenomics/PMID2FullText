      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par2">Successful mammalian reproduction requires normal spermatogenesis, oogenesis, fertilization, and early embryonic development, and defects in any of these processes will result in infertility, recurrent miscarriage, or even birth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In recent years, infertility has been recognized as a long-standing problem and has become more common in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure performed in 1978, assisted reproductive technology (ART) has become a routine treatment for infertility individuals, and it is now estimated that more than six million babies have been delivered by IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, there are still many factors leading to recurrent failure of IVF/ICSI attempts. With the development of ART and advanced genetic assays, it was found that many infertile female patients were caused by variants in various developmental regulators, such as <italic>PATL2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], <italic>TUBB8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], <italic>PADI6</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], et al. These genetic factors have been identified as potential markers for evaluating oocyte quality and providing individualized genetic counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
      <p id="Par3">Pannexin1 (PANX1), which belongs to integral membrane proteins family pannexins, is a highly glycosylated membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It exists as three species: the non-glycosylated protein (GLY0), the high mannose-type glycoprotein (GLY1), and the fully processed glycoprotein (GLY2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a major ATP release and nucleotide permeation channel, PANX1 has been found to implicate in multiple physiological and pathophysiological functions, such as inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], cancer progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], et al. Recent studies have also found that PANX1 is associated with female infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Variants in <italic>PANX1</italic> led to cytoplasmic shrinkage, darkening and death of oocytes before or after fertilization, which was defined as &#x201C;oocyte death&#x201D; phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Preliminary research indicated that variants altered the PANX1 glycosylation pattern, thus resulting in aberrant PANX1 channel activity and ATP release, which negatively affect the development of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite that, the mechanism research on <italic>PANX1</italic> variants and oocyte death is far from completeness and needs continuous exploration.</p>
      <p id="Par4">In our previous work, we preliminary reported a novel <italic>PANX1</italic> variant c.976_978del (p.Asn326del) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, we identified another novel <italic>PANX1</italic> variant c.410&#xA0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Ser137Leu). In this study, we comprehensively investigated the effects of these two variants of <italic>PANX1</italic> in cultured cells, in mouse oocytes, and in human oocytes. This study explores the mechanism of oocyte death related to <italic>PANX1</italic> variants, and expands the variant spectrum of <italic>PANX1</italic>.</p>

        <title>Human subjects and ethics approval</title>
        <p id="Par5">Infertility patients diagnosed with the oocyte death phenotype were recruited from the Center of Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Participants with normal oocytes and embryos in IVF/ICSI cycles were also recruited as the control group. All oocytes and embryos from controls and patients were obtained with written informed consent signed by the donor couples.</p>
        <p id="Par6">This study was approved by the ethics committee on human subject research at Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (TJ-IRB20220450). The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (TJH-202,210,011).</p>

        <title>Wholeexome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing</title>
        <p id="Par7">Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patients and their members for WES to identify potential disease-causing variants according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. The details of the genetic analysis procedure have been well described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Candidate variants identified in the participants were validated by Sanger sequencing analyses conducted on ABI PRISM 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).</p>
        <p id="Par8">The specific filtering process of variant sites was as follows: (a) The variant sites in the 1000 Genomes database and Exome Aggregation Consortium (frequency&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.01 in the population) were filtered, and the inter-individual diversity sites were removed to obtain rare variants that may actually cause disease; (b) The variant sites of exonic region or splicing site region (10&#xA0;bp upstream/downstream) were retained; (c) Synonymous variants (without changing amino acids) were removed to obtain variants that affect gene expression products; (d) The variant sites predicted to have an impact on protein structure or function in more than 2 online variants prediction tools were retained; (e) Screen variations in genes associated with female infertility. At last, we could lock the variants consistent with clinical phenotype and genetic pattern. The details on variant selection were showed in the supplementary table.</p>

        <title>Cell culture and transfection</title>
        <p id="Par11">HeLa cells were obtained from Cancer Biology Research Center of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x2019;s Modifed Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12, KeyGEN Bio TECH, Jiangsu, China) supplemented with 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisten, Nanjing, China) in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C. <italic>PANX1</italic> WT and mutant constructs were transfected into HeLa cells using liposomal transfection reagent (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.</p>

        <p id="Par12">HeLa cells were harvested 36&#xA0;h after transfection and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with 2% of protease inhibitor (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). After incubating on the ice for 20&#xA0;min and centrifuging at 12,000&#xA0;rpm at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C for 20&#xA0;min, protein lysates were collected in a new centrifuge tube. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein quantitative detection kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Then, cell extracts were mixed with 5&#xD7;sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and denatured by boiling at 100 &#x2103; for 10&#xA0;min. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk diluted in 1&#xD7; Tris-buffered saline (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for 1&#xA0;h and incubated at 4&#xA0;&#xB0;C overnight with rabbit anti-PANX1 (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, kind gifts from Lei Wang&#x2019;s lab in Fudan University) or rabbit anti-vinculin (1:1000 dilution, ABclonal, Wuhan, China) antibodies. After incubation with the goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for 1&#xA0;h at room temperature on the secondary day, the membranes were detected by ECL chemiluminescence kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and imaged on a chemiluminescent imaging system (GeneGnome XRQ, Syngene, England).

        <title>Collection and microinjection of mouse GV oocytes and fertilized oocytes</title>
        <p id="Par14">For GV oocytes collection, ovaries were isolated from 6 to 8-week-old Kun-Ming (KM) female mice (Biont, Hubei, China). Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were harvested by puncturing the large ovarian follicles and collected by mouth pipetting on the stage of a dissecting microscope. The GV oocytes were cultured in M2 medium (Aibei Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) under mineral oil (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C.</p>
        <p id="Par15">For fertilized oocytes collection, the 6 to 8-week-old KM female mice were injected with 7.5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Aibei Biotechnology, Nanjing, China). 44&#x2013;48&#xA0;h after PMSG injection, each mouse was injected with 7.5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Aibei Biotechnology, Nanjing, China), and the mice were then euthanized after 14&#xA0;h. Oviducts were removed and transferred to a pre-warmed human tubal fluid (HTF, Aibei Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) medium. Then cumulus oophorus masses (COMs) containing oocytes were removed by dissecting oviducts and transferred to the HTF medium. For sperm collection, 10 to 12-week-old male mice were euthanized, and the epididymal tails were taken out and transferred to a pre-warmed HTF medium. Scratches were made on the tails of the epididymis by an insulin needle to allow sperms to escape. Then they were incubated for 1&#xA0;h to complete the capacitation. Finally, COMs were mixed with sperms in HTF for fertilization. Two pronuclei (2PN) zygotes were collected 6&#xA0;h after fertilization.</p>
        <p id="Par16">The collected mouse GV oocytes and fertilized oocytes were microinjected with WT or mutant <italic>PANX1</italic> cRNAs using a Narishige micromanipulator. About 5 to 10 pl of cRNA solution (250 to 1000 ng/&#xB5;l) was microinjected into the cytoplasm of each mouse oocyte. Injected GV oocytes were matured in vitro in M2 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 12&#xA0;h, and the morphological changes of oocytes were recorded. Injected zygotes were cultured in KSOM medium (Aibei Biotechnology, Nanjing, China) for 12&#xA0;h, and the morphological changes and embryo development were recorded. All oocytes and zygotes were cultured at 37&#xA0;&#xB0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For PANX1 channel inhibition experiments, carbenoxolone (CBX, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) was used at a concentration of 300 &#xB5;M.</p>

        <p id="Par22">Two probands from two independent families have been diagnosed with primary infertility for several years (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The basic information and clinical history of the proband (II-1) in family 1 were reported in detail in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The proband (II-1) in family 2 was a 30-year-old woman with 6-year history of unexplained primary infertility at examination. She had normal ovarian reserves and normal levels of sex hormones with basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 7.53 mIU/mL, luteinizing hormone (LH) 5.7 mIU/mL, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) 3.89 ng/mL. The seminal parameters of her husband showed 51.3&#xA0;million per milliliter of sperm concentration, 56.1% progressive motility, and 4.6% normal sperm morphology per ejaculate. The chromosome karyotypes of the couple were normal. She had undergone one failed IVF Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, . In this IVF cycle, she underwent a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) protocol. The estradiol level on the day of hCG trigger was 1320.0 pg/ml. A total of 15 oocytes were retrieved, 8 of the 12 MII stage oocytes were successfully fertilized. However, all the fertilized oocytes became shrinking in the subsequent culture, degenerated and died within 40&#xA0;h (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).</p>

The proband in family 1 had a heterozygous deletion variant c.976_978del (p.Asn326del), which was inherited from her father, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The proband in family 2 had a heterozygous missense variant c.410&#xA0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Ser137Leu). This is a suspected de novo variant because her parents did not carry the variant of <italic>PANX1</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B).

        <p id="Par30">PANX1 is a highly glycosylated membrane protein. To evaluate the effect of the heterozygous variant on PANX1 glycosylation in vitro, WT and mutated <italic>PANX1</italic> constructs were transfected into HeLa cells.

In addition, in our immunofluorescence experiments, PANX1 was mainly localized on the cell membrane of human control oocytes. While oocytes and embryos from the proband (Family 2, p.Ser137Leu) showed a decrease in cell membrane localization and obvious cytoplasmic aggregation (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B).

        <p id="Par32">To determine whether the <italic>PANX1</italic> variants we identified cause the oocyte death phenotype by altering channel activity, we used a channel inhibitor CBX in a rescue experiment. Mutant p.Asn326del or p.Ser137Leu cRNAs were injected into mouse GV oocytes or into normal 2PN zygotes, which were then cultured in the presence or absence of CBX. In the groups free of CBX, most of the oocytes or zygotes degenerated or died within 12&#xA0;h, whereas oocytes or zygotes incubated with CBX were all viable at 12&#xA0;h (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B and C).

      <p id="Par39">In this study, we identified a heterozygous variant c.410&#xA0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Ser137Leu) in <italic>PANX1</italic> from a non-consanguineous family. Similar to the variant c.976_978del (p.Asn326del) we previously identified, oocytes showed the oocyte death phenotype after fertilization. These two variants altered the PANX1 glycosylation pattern, affected ATP release and membrane electrophysiological properties, and resulted in mouse and human oocyte death in vitro.</p>
      <p id="Par40">In recent years, with the discovery of the heptamer structure of PANX1 by cryo-electron microscopy, this membrane channel protein closely related to ATP release has received more attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, although PANX1 has been found to be involved in many pathophysiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], its role in the reproductive field still lacks clear research. In 2019, Wang et al. first reported the identification of heterozygous <italic>PANX1</italic> variants in female infertility patients, and defined this new infertility phenotype as &#x201C;oocyte death&#x201D; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subsequently, Sang et al. reported two homozygous variants of <italic>PANX1</italic> caused oocyte death with an autosomal recessive (AR) mode, and the destructive effect of the two homozygous variants on PANX1 function was weaker than that caused by the previous reported heterozygous variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Recently, Tan et al. reported the seventh identified variant of <italic>PANX1</italic> related to oocyte death, followed by an autosomal dominant (AD) mode with reduced penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our recently identified <italic>PANX1</italic> variant c.976_978del (p.Asn326del), most of the oocytes died after fertilization, but there was also high-quality embryo that could be transferred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The differential effects of variants sites on protein function have been analyzed in detail in our previous report on variant c.976_978del [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, these results indicate that different locations of variants might appear to different effects on the function of PANX1 and inheritance patterns might also be affected.</p>
      <p id="Par41">In the present study, we identified a novel <italic>PANX1</italic> variant c.410&#xA0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Ser137Leu). Molecular mechanism studies suggest that variant p.Ser137Leu affects the structural stability of <italic>PANX1</italic>, which may lead to functional abnormalities. As the level of glycosylation is critical for the cellular localization and the function of the PANX1 channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], glycosylation assay is an important part of assessing PANX1 function. Similar to the previously identified variants, the variant p.Ser137Leu changed the glycosylation pattern of PANX1, thus affecting the intracellular localization of PAXN1. It is worth noting that variant p. Ser137Leu resulted in the complete deletion of GLY0 and GLY1 species, which may be due to the decrease of protein stability and early degradation caused by variant. The difference of variant sites will be further studied in the future.</p>
      <p id="Par42">Previous studies have shown that <italic>Panx1</italic> knockout mice have no obvious fertility defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. And the engineered OE-PANX1<sup>Q392*</sup> female mice were completely infertile with the oocyte death phenotype, implying that the oocyte death phenotype was caused by a gain-of-function effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, even in the presence of WT allele, the molecular mechanism of oocyte death caused by <italic>PANX1</italic> variant can still be explored by direct injection of mutant cRNAs in mouse oocyte and embryo. Oocytes and embryos injected with variant cRNAs showed oocyte death phenotype in a dose-dependent manner. Although the embryonic phenotype is similar, unlike mouse oocytes, the probands&#x2019; oocytes can survive before fertilization. This phenotypic difference may be affected by species and the concentration of cRNAs injected. The use of channel inhibitor CBX can reverse this phenotype, suggesting that the altered channel activity of mutant PANX1 is an crucial cause of oocyte death. This altered channel activity is also reflected in the significantly enhanced cell membrane potential and disordered ATP release. Therefore, the changes of channel activity caused by variants affect the regulation of ATP release by PANX1, which ultimately leads to oocyte death.</p>
      <p id="Par43">For the first time, we further presented the direct evidence of the effect of the <italic>PANX1</italic> variants on human oocytes development by injecting cRNAs into human oocytes, which is of great significance for exploring the effect of species differences on oocyte death phenotype. Our study utilized human oocytes and embryos as research objects, which would be more accurate and intuitive for the observation and outcome assessment of genetic mutations. Our results further confirm that the identified heterozygous variants c.976_978del (p.Asn326del) and c.410&#xA0;C&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;T (p.Ser137Leu) in <italic>PANX1</italic> are responsible for oocyte death and female infertility.</p>
      <p id="Par44">On the basis of clarifying the pathogenic genes, finding a resolved method to achieve a successful pregnancy is a more clinical concern. Successful pregnancy has been reported in some studies on infertility-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, despite attempts to transfer good quality embryos, the currently identified infertile patients carrying the <italic>PANX1</italic> variants have not yet achieved a successful pregnancy. Our results suggest that CBX has a strong ameliorating effect on the phenotypic changes in oocytes caused by <italic>PANX1</italic> variants, which gives us inspiring clues in exploration the appropriate solution methods for these specific patients in the future. However, in consideration of the influence of long term inhibition of ion channels by CBX on embryo viability, the mechanism of PANX1 needs to be further studied to explore more precise therapy strategy in improving the prognosis of such patients.</p>
