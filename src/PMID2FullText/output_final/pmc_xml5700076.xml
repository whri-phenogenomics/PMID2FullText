      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">The short QT syndrome (SQTS), first recognized in 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, is a rare, genetically determined, severe arrhythmogenic disease with a high risk of syncope, atrial and ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death (SCD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Cardiac events have a clear male preponderance, typically presenting during the 2nd or 3rd decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The treatment after aborted SCD and malignant ventricular arrhythmia is implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. SQTS has only been reported to present in an autosomal inherited dominant form. The diagnostic criteria for SQTS proposed by Gollob et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> were based on a combination of shortened duration of the repolarisation (QT interval), family- and clinical history. A frequency corrected QT (QTc)&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;370&#x2009;ms was suggested as an initial cutoff for diagnostic consideration of SQTS, whereas the HRS/EHRA/APHRS Expert Consensus Statement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> suggested QTc&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;330&#x2009;ms as a stand-alone criterion for the SQTS diagnosis or a possible diagnosis if QTc&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;360&#x2009;ms in combination with a pathogenic mutation, family- or clinical history.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Disease-causing mutations have been identified in the cardiac potassium ion channels <italic>KCNH2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, <italic>KCNQ1</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and <italic>KCNJ2</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> leading to gain of channel function and causing action potential duration (APD) shortening and elevated risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for the subunits of the cardiac L-type calcium channels <italic>CACNA1C</italic>, <italic>CACNB2</italic> and <italic>CACNA2D1</italic>, have recently been identified as separate genetic causes of SQTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. So far, only these six cation channels have been implicated in SQTS, and most expanded genetic screening therefore focuses on cation channel genes. However, considering that identified cation channel mutations explain &lt;25% of SQTS cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, other classes of genes are likely to be associated with the development of this disease. Such genes may encode anion channels, transporters, or proteins involved in pH regulation, which could all potentially alter the QT interval. A role for changes in pH is supported by the finding that lowering intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) prolongs QT interval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; a role for Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> is supported by the demonstration that modulation of Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> conductance in cardiomyocytes also changes APD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">In this study, we identify a novel genetic etiology for SQTS in a family with presumed autosomal dominant inheritance of SQTS. We find that affected family members have a mutation in the anion exchanger Solute Carrier Family 4 Member 3 (<italic>SLC4A3</italic>) gene, which encodes a Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchanger (AE3). The mutation leads to a trafficking defect, decreased Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange over the cell membrane, increased pH<sub>i</sub> and it reduces QT-duration in zebrafish embryos. These findings represent a previously unappreciated mechanism for the development of SQTS.</p>

        <title>Cardiac manifestations in probands and relatives with SQTS</title>
        <p id="Par6">Pedigrees and demographics for the families are presented in Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The index patient (III-17) in family 1 presented 31 years old with cardiac arrest during sleep. He was successfully resuscitated and admitted to hospital where a new episode of ventricular fibrillation was converted to sinus rhythm by DC shock (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). In his ECG, a QTc duration of 320&#x2009;ms and a J-point to T-peak interval (Jp-Tp) of 120&#x2009;ms (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) were noted. No other cardiac abnormalities were observed. A structurally normal heart was found in all relatives, except for subject IV-13, who showed dilated cardiomyopathy with decreased systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. This patient was later diagnosed with Limb-Girdle muscle dystrophy type 2I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Four relatives (II-8, II-10, IV-1, III-13) experienced syncopes in the second decade, and two relatives (III-4, III-5) died suddenly and unexplained at the age of 41 and 42 years, respectively. In family 2, the proband (II-1) died suddenly unexpectedly at rest 22 years old. His brother (II-2) was asymptomatic with a structurally normal heart and a QTc of 320&#x2009;ms and a Jp-Tp&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;120&#x2009;ms (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). The parents were asymptomatic; the mother&#x2019;s QTc was 355&#x2009;ms. Cascade screening in family 2 revealed two more asymptomatic mutation-carrying relatives (II-2, II-3) with short QTc&#x2019;s in both (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

        <title>Whole exome sequencing of family members</title>
        <p id="Par7">Initial analysis of the family 1 index patient using a targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) gene panel including the SQTS genes, known to be associated with SQTS at that time (<italic>CACNA1C</italic>, <italic>CACNB2</italic>, <italic>KCNH2</italic>, <italic>KCNQ1</italic>, and <italic>KCNJ2</italic>, Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) revealed no pathogenic mutations. Exome sequencing of four SQTS-affected individuals from family 1 (III-17, IV-1, IV-3, IV-4) along with four asymptomatic family members with normal ECGs (I-6, II-6, III-16, IV-2) was performed (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Three members from family 2, who were referred to the clinic at the time of the analysis, were also exome sequenced (Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par8">Variants were filtered to include variants shared by all six SQTS individuals but not present in any of the five healthy controls. After removal of variants observed in publicly available databases (frequency&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;5%) only 11 variants remained. Nine were outside gene regions, one was intronic (chr19:52149499:c421&#x2013;11A&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;G, <italic>SIGLEC14</italic>), not predicted to affect splicing, and one was a heterozygous missense variant (chr2:220497051:c.1109&#x2009;G&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;A NM_201574, p.R370H) in <italic>SLC4A3</italic> (Supplementary Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par14">We report that a mutation in the <italic>SLC4A3</italic> gene, which encodes the cardiac chloride-bicarbonate exchanger AE3, is associated with SQTS. Within a large affected family, the group of carriers had experienced several serious cardiac events and SCD, whereas no events had occurred in non-carriers. All carriers had a QTc&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;370&#x2009;ms and all non-carriers had a QTc&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;370&#x2009;ms. The J-point to T-peak interval was&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;140&#x2009;ms in all carriers. Jp-Tp has been suggested as a parameter to be applied in the diagnostic score of SQTS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and has been reported to have a high specificity for the SQTS and is clinically readily recognizable on visual ECG inspection. These ECG findings indicate a high penetrance as assessed by repolarization duration, the equivalent of the APD. In agreement with findings in other SQTS families, clinical manifestations were present in males only, and absent in children. Out of 27 living mutation carriers from the two families, six showed cardiac events considered SQTS related. The mutation leads to reduced trafficking of AE3 to the membrane, loss of Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange and increased pH<sub>i</sub>. The role of the mutation was emphasized by the identification of the same mutation in an unrelated family with SQTS and by the finding that <italic>slc4a3</italic> knockdown in zebrafish causes increased pH<sub>i</sub>, short QTc, and reduced systolic contraction duration, which was rescued by wildtype but not R370H-mutated AE3. Thus, our data show the involvement of an anion transporter in the development of SQTS.</p>
      <p id="Par15">Previously, other <italic>SLC4A3</italic> variants have been associated with seizures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

However, none of the mutation-carriers in our two families has had any clinical presentations with unconsciousness suspected to be due to epileptic events. The case with aSCD had documented VF.</p>
      <p id="Par16">AE3 is a comprehensively studied Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchanger with the highest mRNA expression of the HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x2212;</sup> transporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> in mouse hearts. AE3 is known to be important for myocardial pH<sub>i</sub> recovery from alkaline loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, AE3 knockout mice show no overt cardiac phenotype unless crossed with Na,K,Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>exchanger knockout mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or mice carrying a mutation in &#x3B1;-tropomyosin in a model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. No electrophysiological characterization of the hearts of the AE3 knockout mice has been published though.</p>
      <p id="Par17">The identified mutation of the <italic>SLC4A3</italic> gene causes a single-residue Arg-to-His change at amino acid position 370 of AE3, which is part of the E<sub>367</sub>-T-A-R-W-I-K-F-E-E<sub>376</sub> motif. This motif is highly conserved in all SLC4 gene products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Previously, a Glu-to-Arg mutation in position 91 of NBCe1/SLC4A4 (position equivalent to Glu375 of AE3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> has been found to cause poor surface targeting upon expression in MDCK cells. By analysis of an NBCe1 homology model, Arg370 has been proposed to interact with Glu376 (equivalent to Glu92 in NBCe1) through a salt bridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. We find by further homology modeling that in addition, Arg370 may form a cation-&#x3C0; interaction with Trp385 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These two structural elements hint to a fixed structural environment that spatially orientates Arg370 and could lead to misfolding if disrupted with a mutation to histidine. In agreement with these data, we found that the mutated variant (Arg-370-His) showed a level of translation similar to wild-type AE3, but only poor surface targeting.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Molecular interaction in direct contact with Arg370.

</p>
      <p id="Par18">The reduced membrane trafficking is strongly supported by the reduced Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange activity observed in transfected cells expressing the mutated variant. The data therefore strongly suggest that the mutation leads to trans-membraneous Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x2212;</sup> transport deficits, which might increase pH<sub>i</sub> and reduce [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p>
      <p id="Par19">There is some evidence that modulation of AE3 activity leads to changes in pH<sub>i</sub> and [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. In AE3 KO mice there is a tendency to a higher steady state pH<sub>i</sub> in isolated cardiomyocytes compared to pH<sub>i</sub> in cardiomyocytes from WT mice and the recovery time from an imposed intracellular alkalosis is significantly prolonged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This is consistent with the effect of an inhibitory AE3 antibody on pH<sub>i</sub> in rat cardiomyocytes. Thus, in the presence of endothelin-1, inhibition of AE3 increased pH<sub>i</sub>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, &#x3B1;-adrenergic receptor activation of the rat heart reduces steady state pH<sub>i</sub> most likely through activation of AE3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that in hearts expressing the mutated AE3, the capacity to counteract an increase in pH<sub>i</sub> is compromised, particularly under in vivo conditions where the heart is exposed to various hormones and neurotransmitters. Our finding of an increased steady state pH<sub>i</sub> in the hearts of zebrafish embryos with knockdown of AE3 is consistent with this. It has been suggested that activation of AE3 during ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and extracellular acidosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> contribute to the increase in guinea pig and sheep ventricular muscle [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This indicates that the effect of AE3 on [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may also depend on conditions. Although these findings suggest that inhibition of AE3 mediated anion transport leads to increased pH<sub>i</sub> and decreased [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> this conclusion may need further validation.</p>
      <p id="Par20">Since the AE3 mutation increased pH<sub>i</sub> and likely decreases [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we tested the effects of increased pH<sub>i</sub> and decreased [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> on myocyte electrophysiology. Increased pH<sub>i</sub> was associated with a shortened APD in rabbit heart. This finding is consistent with the finding of an APD prolongation by low pH<sub>i</sub> in rabbit ventricular myocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. It is unclear how this effect is mediated. However, high pH<sub>i</sub> activates Kv7.1 channels (KCNQ1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which may accelerate repolarization. The knowledge about the effects of high pH<sub>i</sub> on cardiac ion channels seems very limited. For <italic>KCNH2</italic> we are not aware of studies addressing the effect of high pH<sub>i</sub>. For the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels the effect of high pH<sub>i</sub> is likely inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> which would also accelerate repolarization.</p>
      <p id="Par21">We demonstrated that also reduced [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> leads to shortened APD. A reduction of [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> will cause the equilibrium potential for Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> to be more negative and hence increase the Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> influx in phase 2 and the beginning of phase 3 leading to a shorter action potential. This finding is consistent with studies where different Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> channels in cardiomyocytes are inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Together this demonstrates that low [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> due to inhibition of AE3 activity might contribute directly to the SQTS.</p>
      <p id="Par22">We suggest that both high pH<sub>i</sub> and low [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are likely to contribute to the SQTS, but cannot exclude that other effects may also contribute.</p>
      <p id="Par23">The low event rate during follow-up indicates the difficulties in predicting the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or SCD in patients with SQTS and underscores the importance of developing risk scores. The clinical course of more families with AE3 mutations&#x2014;probably to be identified in the pool of SQTS patients with hitherto negative genetic test results&#x2014;will be needed to identify AE3 mutation specific clinical risk factors.</p>
      <p id="Par24">In summary, we have identified a novel mutation in AE3 in two independent families with SQTS. The mutation leads to defective targeting of AE3 to the cell membrane, reduction of Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange and increased pH<sub>i</sub>. The impact of the mutation on QTc duration was confirmed in zebrafish and the mechanism through which a defect in Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange leads to shortened QTc likely relates to a combined effect of a decrease in HCO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>&#x2212;</sup> efflux (i.e., increased pH<sub>i</sub>) and a decrease in Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> influx. These findings offer insight into mechanisms of arrhythmia in general and may provide new treatment possibilities in patients with SQTS. Currently, no specific factors triggering arrhythmia in patients with SQTS have been reported. Based on this study, possible triggers may include medications, physical activities, metabolic derangements or diets challenging the Cl,HCO<sub>3</sub>-exchange.</p>
      <p id="Par25">Further studies are required to determine the frequency of involvement of <italic>SLC4A3</italic> in SQTS and to delineate details of how high pH<sub>i</sub> and low [Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may lead to the serious arrhythmia associated with SQTS.</p>
