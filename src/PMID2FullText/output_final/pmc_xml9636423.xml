        <p id="Par1">Embryonic development is dictated by tight regulation of DNA replication, cell division and differentiation. Mutations in DNA repair and replication genes disrupt this equilibrium, giving rise to neurodevelopmental disease characterized by microcephaly, short stature and chromosomal breakage. Here, we identify biallelic variants in two components of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 genome stability pathway, <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic>, in 11 patients with microcephaly, short stature, cardiac abnormalities and anemia. Patient-derived cells exhibit a unique chromosomal instability phenotype consisting of segmented and dicentric chromosomes with mosaic variegated hyperploidy. To signify the importance of these segmented chromosomes, we have named this disorder Atel&#xED;s (meaning - incomplete) Syndrome. Analysis of Atel&#xED;s Syndrome cells reveals elevated levels of replication stress, partly due to a reduced ability to replicate through G-quadruplex DNA structures, and also loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Together, these data strengthen the functional link between SLF2 and the SMC5/6 complex, highlighting a distinct role for this pathway in maintaining genome stability.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Despite the fundamental nature of DNA replication and cell division, inherited variants in genes involved in these processes are an underlying cause of human disease. Whilst these syndromes usually display unique clinical features that define them diagnostically, they typically exhibit common neurodevelopmental deficits, such as severe microcephaly and pre- and post-natal growth retardation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. As such, many of these syndromes can be collectively referred to as microcephalic dwarfism (MD) disorders. This constellation of conditions includes Meier-Gorlin Syndrome, Seckel Syndrome Spectrum Disorders, Bloom Syndrome and Microcephalic Osteodysplastic Primordial Dwarfism type II and can be broadly classified as having deficiencies in one of three cellular processes: DNA replication, DNA repair, and mitotic cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Although mechanistically distinct, the common clinical phenotypes exhibited by these diseases are thought to result from a reduction in cellular proliferation and/or excessive cell death in the developing embryo, which reduces the number of cells available to maintain normal foetal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Cells from these patients often exhibit signs of increased genome instability, such as micronuclei and/or elevated chromosome breakage. A distinct subgroup of these syndromes exhibit rare cytogenetic anomalies, for example, mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome (MVA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> caused by variants in the spindle assembly checkpoint genes <italic>BUB1B</italic>, <italic>CEP57</italic> and <italic>TRIP13</italic>, or rail-road chromosomes and premature chromatid separation (PCS) associated with Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS) and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, caused by variants in the helicase DDX11 and components of SMC1/3 cohesin complex respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Whilst, the presence of these chromosomal abnormalities is a useful diagnostic tool they can also help dissect the cellular mechanisms underlying the disease pathology.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Here, we report 11 patients with a neurodevelopmental disorder overlapping clinically with MVA and Fanconi Anemia (FA) with pathogenic variants in SLF2 and SMC5, two components of the recently discovered RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 genome stability pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The precise function of the SMC5/6 complex remains enigmatic, however, it has been linked to a number of fundamental processes, including DNA transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair and chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Evidence suggests that the primary function of this complex occurs during DNA replication to stabilize stalled forks, suppress the activity of pro-recombination factors and promote efficient replication through difficult-to-replicate and/or repetitive regions of the genome, such as rDNA and telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, the function of SLF1 and SLF2 remain unclear, other than a reported role in recruiting the SMC5/6 complex to sites of DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">Analysis of SLF2 and SMC5 patient-derived cell lines revealed spontaneous replication stress and multiple mitotic abnormalities that give rise to a unique, diagnostically relevant, genome instability phenotype consisting of segmented, dicentric and rail-road chromosomes, and mosaic variegated hyperploidy (MVH). The underlying basis for this chromosomal instability is not fully understood, but our data suggest that it may arise, in part, from the failed resolution of aberrant DNA structures during S-phase, such as G-quadruplexes (G4), potentially leading to a combination of under-replicated DNA and unresolved recombination intermediates persisting through to mitosis. Together, these data demonstrate that despite a hitherto unknown role as a core component of the SMC5/6 complex, SLF2 is essential for the SMC5/6 cohesin-like complex to maintain genome stability by regulating both DNA replication and cell division.</p>

        <p id="Par8">All individuals with <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic> variants presented with a similar clinical phenotype, including marked microcephaly (&#x2212;3.57 to &#x2212;11.88 SD) and a reduction in height (-2.19 to -8.24 SD) (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Data&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Moreover, the majority of patients also exhibited a developmental delay along with learning difficulties. Mild skeletal defects (i.e., clinodactyly), skin hyperpigmentation and ocular abnormalities were present in several patients (Supplementary Data&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Notably, two of seven SLF2 patients (P4-1, P5) and all four SMC5 patients (P7, P8, P9-1 and P9-2) displayed cardiac defects (Supplementary Data&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>), such as atrial or ventricular defects, a phenotype commonly observed in patients with cohesinopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> but not DNA replication disorders. Furthermore, five of eleven patients (P3, P4-1, P4-2, P5, P9-2) also developed anemia, with one of these patients (P9-2) subsequently developing myelodysplastic syndrome (Supplementary Data&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This, coupled with other clinical features, could potentially result in future cases being mistakenly diagnosed with an atypical form of FA in the absence of a clear genetic diagnosis using WES.

        <p id="Par10">We next investigated the <italic>SLF2</italic> variants in patients P2 and P3 in more detail. Analysis of cDNA from the SLF2-P3 cell line demonstrated that the synonymous homozygous variant c.3330G&gt;A (p.Arg1110Arg), disrupted splicing leading to an in-frame deletion of exon 17 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a, b</xref>). We then analysed the impact of the c.3486G&gt;C (p.Gln1162His) variant, present in patient P2, on splicing. Multiple <italic>SLF2</italic> transcripts are annotated in the human genome and although c.3486G&gt;C (p.Gln1162His) introduces a nonsynonymous change in the two longest transcripts (NM_018121 and NM_001136123), it only affects mRNA splicing of the most abundant <italic>SLF2</italic> transcript (NM_018121) by impairing the exon 19 splice donor splice site (Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>c, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a&#x2013;e</xref>). The p.(Gln1162His) variant also displayed compromised protein stability when expressed transiently indicating that this variant disrupts both mRNA and protein stability (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3f</xref>). Together, these data suggest that most of the identified <italic>SLF2</italic> variants have an adverse effect on protein stability.</p>
        <p id="Par11">In contrast, analysis of SMC5 patient cell lines revealed that the homozygous p.(His990Asp) variant present in patients P8, P9-1 and P9-2 had little detectable impact on the protein stability of SMC5, or RAD18, SLF2, and SMC6 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Only a cell line derived from patient P7 exhibited a reduced abundance of SMC5 protein, presumably due to the presence of a nonsense variant (p.Arg425Ter) on one of the <italic>SMC5</italic> alleles. As loss of Smc5 is embryonically lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, it is possible that the <italic>SMC5</italic> variants are hypomorphic and that significant disruption of SMC5 protein stability to the extent observed with the SLF2 variants is incompatible with life.</p>
        <p id="Par12">SLF1 and SLF2 have been identified as bridging factors between RAD18 and the SMC5/6 complex at sites of stalled replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. To address whether the SLF2 and SMC5 variants compromised their ability to bind components of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway, we initially mapped the binding sites of RAD18, SLF1 and SMC6 on SLF2. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis with tagged proteins, we determined that the binding of RAD18 and SLF1 to SLF2 requires the C-terminal 471 amino acids (aa702-1173), which also overlapped with the SMC6 binding site located at amino acids 589&#x2013;810 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a&#x2013;d</xref>). All patient-associated variants in SLF2, with the exception of p.(Gln1162His), are located within or truncate the SLF1/RAD18 binding domain of SLF2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Consistent with SLF1 binding being essential for SLF2 to mediate bridging between RAD18 and the SMC5/6 complex, co-immunoprecipitation studies using extracts from hydroxyurea (HU) treated SLF2 patient-derived LCLs revealed a failure of all cell lines tested to co-purify SMC6 with RAD18 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Furthermore, all SLF2-mutant proteins, with the exception of p.(Gln1162His), failed to or exhibited a reduced ability to, be recruited to sites of DNA damage induced by laser micro-irradiation (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par13">We next extended the co-immunoprecipitation analysis to include SMC5 patient LCLs (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The interaction between RAD18 and SMC6 in SMC5-P8 and SMC5-P9-1 cells was observed to be at WT levels, suggesting that p.(His990Asp) had no discernible impact on the integrity of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 complex, whereas the association of RAD18 with SMC6 was partially affected in SMC5-P7 cells. However, both the p.(Arg372del) and p.(His990Asp) SMC5 mutants failed to re-localize efficiently to sites of laser micro-irradiation induced damage, with the latter being more severely affected (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4f</xref>). These observations indicate that whilst these variants largely do not appear to compromise their binding to components of the RAD18-SLF1-SLF2-SMC5/6 pathway, they do affect their re-localization to and/or retention at sites of damage.</p>
        <p id="Par14">To gain insight into why the SMC5 mutants affected stability of the SMC5/6 complex at sites of damage, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis to assess if these mutations affected binding to other components of the complex. Interestingly, whilst the p.(His990Asp) mutation did not significantly affect binding to other components of the SMC5/6 complex, the p.(Arg372del) significantly compromised binding to SLF2, SMC6 and NSMCE2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Moreover, endogenous NSMCE2 exhibited reduced binding to SMC5 in cells from patient SMC5-P7 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the Nse2 binding site on yeast Smc5 lies in close proximity to Lys368, which is the yeast functional equivalent of human SMC5 Arg372 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). This suggests that the failure of the p.(Arg372del) mutant SMC5 to be recruited to sites of laser damage may be due to this mutation compromising the binding of other key components of the SMC5/6 complex.</p>
        <p id="Par15">To explore the possibility that the p.(His990Asp) may have a deleterious impact on the structure of the SMC5/6 complex, we compared the AlphaFold model for human SMC5 to the X-ray crystal structures for the head domain of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> Rad50 (<italic>Pf</italic>.Rad50) in both the unliganded and ATP-bound forms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Notably, His990 lies just upstream of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) signature motif of Smc5 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>), a region of the protein implicit in both binding ATP and mediating the complex set of conformational changes that occur when SMC proteins bind nucleotide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, His990 sits in a position functionally equivalent to Phe791 of <italic>Pf</italic>.Rad50 - a&#xA0;residue known to interact directly with the adenine moiety of bound ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Whilst mutation of His990 to aspartic acid would appear to be tolerated and unlikely to cause any gross-misfolding of the protein, as judged by the lack of steric clashes produced by the mutation (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>), it removes an aromatic amino acid and replaces it with one carrying a negative charge. As such, this would alter the overall charge of a region that normally functions to accept the adenine moiety. Therefore, it is likely that the p.(His990Asp) mutation perturbs the ability of the complex to either bind or turnover ATP, in turn affecting its association with, or retention on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

        <p id="Par21">To confirm these observations, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in U-2 OS cells to generate SLF2 knockout clones. Despite several attempts we were unable to generate complete SLF2 knockout clones. Rather, we generated two hypomorphic (HM) clones, each with one expressed mutant allele of <italic>SLF2</italic> in conjunction with one or more truncating mutant alleles: SLF2 HM cl.1 (p.Asn411Lysins16, p.Ser403Ter, p.Asn411LysfsTer3) and SLF2 HM cl.2 (p.Asp398_Ser404del, p.Ser403ThrfsTer14). These clones were subsequently complemented by re-expressing WT <italic>SLF2</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Importantly, DNA fiber analysis of these SLF2 HM clones demonstrated that the vector complemented SLF2 HM cell lines exhibited significantly elevated levels of spontaneous fork stalling compared to the WT SLF2 complemented clones (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par22">Since spontaneous replication stress exhibited by cells can be attributed to defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling, we used DNA fiber analysis and western blotting to monitor activation of the ATR-dependent stress response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In contrast to the ATR-Seckel syndrome cell line, all the SLF2 or SMC5 patient cell lines were capable of activating ATR or the intra-S phase checkpoint in response to HU and MMC (Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11e, f</xref>,&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>) indicating that dysregulation of the ATR stress response pathway does not account for the observed DNA replication defects.

        <p id="Par23">We next investigated the cellular impact of the increased spontaneous replication fork instability observed in the patient cell lines using different markers of replication stress. Significantly, both SLF2 and SMC5 patient cell lines exhibited elevated signs of spontaneous replication stress including the presence of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in S-phase cells (53BP1 foci in EdU positive cells), an increased frequency of mitotic cells undergoing mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS), elevated levels of 53BP1 G1 bodies and the formation of micronuclei (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a&#x2013;d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a&#x2013;d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

        <title>Hypomorphic variants in <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic> are associated with mitotic abnormalities, segmented chromosomes, cohesion defects and mosaic variegated hyperploidy</title>
        <p id="Par24">Consistent with the elevated levels of spontaneous replication stress, LCLs derived from SLF2 and SMC5 mutant patients all exhibited increased levels of chromosomal aberrations (such as chromosome and chromatid gaps/breaks and chromosome radials) comparable to that observed in an ATR-Seckel Syndrome LCL (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f, g</xref>). Notably, this phenotype was not significantly exacerbated by exposure to either APH or MMC, unlike LCLs from an ATR-Seckel Syndrome patient (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15a, b</xref>). Importantly, the elevated spontaneous levels of chromosomal aberrations in the SLF2/SMC5 patient fibroblasts and the U-2 OS SLF2 HM cells, were&#xA0;rescued by re-expression of either WT <italic>SLF2</italic> or <italic>SMC5</italic> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h, i</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par25">In addition to the spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, metaphase spread analysis of both the peripheral blood and patient-derived LCLs of SLF2 and SMC5 patients revealed that a significant subset of cells exhibited large increases in chromosome numbers, with some metaphases having &gt;100 chromosomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>; Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16a, b</xref>,&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a</xref>).

        <p id="Par26">To investigate the cause of the MVH, we explored whether SLF2 or SMC5 patient-derived cell lines exhibited spontaneous mitotic abnormalities. Both SLF2 and SMC5 patient fibroblast cell lines, and U-2 OS SLF2 HM cells, displayed a significant increase in mitotic cells with lagging chromosomes in empty vector complemented cells compared to cells re-expressing WT protein (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b&#x2013;d</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, when we examined the origins of these lagging chromosomes/micronuclei using CENPA as a marker of centromeres, it was evident that a significant proportion of the micronuclei were positive for CENPA, suggesting that they could have resulted from failed mitotic segregation (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16c, d</xref>). This is supportive of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway playing an important role in promoting proper chromosomal segregation.</p>
        <p id="Par27">Since SMC5/6 forms a cohesin-like complex and has been implicated in facilitating centromeric and sister chromatid cohesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, we analysed metaphase spreads from SLF2 and SMC5 patient-derived cells for the presence of cohesion defects. SLF2 and SMC5 peripheral blood lymphocytes showed loss of sister chromatid cohesion as evidenced by the presence of rail-road chromosomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17b</xref>). Moreover, SLF2 and SMC5 patient-derived LCLs exhibited PCS after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which is known to induce cohesion fatigue by preventing the metaphase-to-anaphase transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the MVH characteristic to SLF2 and SMC5 patient cells may also be caused by PCS resulting from cohesion fatigue.</p>
        <p id="Par28">However, given the extent of the karyotypic abnormalities it seemed plausible that other cellular defects may contribute to the large increases in chromosome number seen in SLF2 and SMC5 mutant cell lines in addition to PCS. Replication stress can trigger centrosome amplification via fragmentation of the pericentriolar material (PCM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> or premature centriole disengagement, which can lead to mitotic arrest and aneuploidy-induced cell death and microcephaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. To investigate whether centrosome abnormalities could contribute to the cellular pathology associated with SLF2 and SMC5 dysfunction, patient-derived cell lines were subjected to immunofluorescence with antibodies to PCNT1 (a component of the PCM) and mitosin/CENPF (marker of S/G2 cells) before and after incubation with aphidicolin (APH). Notably, following APH exposure a significant proportion of S/G2 cells possessed more than two centrosomes (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>). We also observed that APH treatment had a profound effect on mitosis with &gt;10&#x2013;50% of SLF2 and SMC5 patient-derived LCLs exhibiting multi-polar spindles during mitosis (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16e</xref>). This increase in centrosome number and multi-polar spindles is not due to higher levels of replication stress in the APH treated patient cells as quantification of APH-induced G1 53BP1 bodies revealed no difference between empty vector and WT SLF2/SMC5 complemented cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7i</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the MVH observed in SLF2 and SMC5 patient cells arises as a consequence of multiple defects including unresolved replication stress, PCS, chromosome mis-segregation and centrosome amplification.</p>

In line with SLF2 and SMC5 dysfunction causing unresolved HR intermediates to accumulate and this leading to increased genome instability, expression of WT RusA increased the level of spontaneous chromosome aberrations in SLF2/SMC5 mutant cells lines complemented with an empty vector but not with WT SLF2 or SMC5 (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19d, e</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par31">It is known that the SMC5/6 complex is important for the dissolution of replication stress-induced recombination, especially at repetitive regions prone to forming secondary structures and natural replication pause site intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This is consistent with our observations that the replication stress phenotype observed in SLF2/SMC5 mutant cells was not markedly exacerbated by exposure to MMC, APH and HU (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; Supplementary Figs.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that RNF168, which promotes the recruitment of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway to damaged replication forks, is important for signaling the presence of G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures stabilized by the RNA polymerase I inhibitor, CX5461<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Since cells deficient in BRCA1/2 and the cohesin-associated helicase DDX11 are also hypersensitive to this agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and DDX11 was shown to function with SMC5/6 to repair DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway might play a role in suppressing replication stress at sites of stabilized G4 structures. To test this possibility, we first investigated the effects of CX5461 on DNA replication using DNA fiber analysis. This revealed that whilst WT SLF2 and SMC5 expressing patient fibroblasts could replicate normally in the presence of CX5461, SLF2 and SMC5 patient fibroblasts complemented with an empty vector exhibited a significant reduction in replication fork speed when incubated with this G4-stabilizing compound (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Additionally, SLF2 and SMC5 patient-derived fibroblasts, LCLs and U-2 OS SLF2 HM cells treated with CX5461 exhibited increased levels of G1-phase 53BP1 bodies and chromosome aberrations (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20a, c</xref>). In keeping with this, LCLs from SLF2-P1 and SMC5-P8 displayed an increased sensitivity to CX5461 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>). Strikingly, we also observed that CX5461 treatment induced a significant increase in the levels of type 1 segmented chromosomes in the SLF2 and SMC5 patient LCLs, but not in the WT LCLs (Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20b</xref>). These data suggest a role for SLF2 and the SMC5/6 complex in resolving replication stress at sites of stabilized G4 structures.</p>
        <p id="Par32">Whilst CX5461 is known to inhibit RNA polymerase I and stabilize G-quadruplexes, more recently it has also been identified as a TOP2 poison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Given the pleiotropic nature of CX5461, we sought to identify which genotoxic lesion induced by CX5461 was causing the increased replication stress in cells deficient in components of the SMC5/6 complex. In this respect, we carried out DNA fiber and chromosomal aberration analysis on patient-derived cell lines following exposure to pyridostatin (a G-quadruplex stabilizer), etoposide (a TOP2 poison) and BMH21 (an RNA polymerase I inhibitor). Interestingly, only exposure to pyridostatin caused a significant reduction in replication progression and an increase in the levels of chromosome aberrations in SLF2 and SMC5 mutant cell lines (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par33">Taken together, these observations support the notion that the spontaneous replication stress and chromosomal instability displayed by cells from patients with SLF2/SMC5 mutations is caused, in part, by an inability to resolve a specific subset of replication-associated recombination intermediates arising at sites of G4 structures.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par34">Disrupting the delicate balance between stem cell proliferation and differentiation profoundly affects embryonic development, particularly body growth and brain development. Rapidly proliferating pluripotent stem cells exhibit constitutively high levels of replication stress and as such are heavily reliant on replication-associated DNA damage response pathways to maintain genome stability. Unsurprisingly, patients with pathogenic variants in genes encoding components of the replisome, the DNA damage response (DDR) and factors that maintain sister chromatid cohesion exhibit developmental abnormalities including severe microcephaly and dwarfism. Furthermore, variants in centrosome components and regulators of the microtubule-spindle network can also result in these developmental abnormalities by affecting the orientation of the spindle pole and/or triggering excessive cell death through the generation of aneuploid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, it is often difficult to determine whether the cellular pathology underlying the development of these neurodevelopmental disorders results primarily from the presence of aberrant replication or defective mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par35">Here we report the clinical and genetic characterization of 11 patients with biallelic variants in two components of the newly described RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 DDR pathway, <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic>, exhibiting microcephaly, short stature, cardiac defects and anemia. However, in contrast to FA and other known disorders, cells from these patients exhibit a unique chromosomal instability phenotype, hallmarked by segmented and dicentric chromosomes and mosaic variegated hyperploidy, arising from a combination of replication stress- and mitosis-associated cellular pathologies. Given that the segmented chromosomes seen in SLF2 and SMC5 patient cells represent a chromosome instability phenotype not previously associated with any known DNA repair or replication deficiency disorder, we have named this syndrome, Atel&#xED;s Syndrome (ATS), after the Greek word for incomplete to signify the importance of these atelic or segmented chromosomes as a diagnostic marker of the disease.</p>
      <p id="Par36">The SMC5/6 complex has been shown to have many functions in the cell, including regulating homologous recombination (HR)-dependent DNA repair, stabilizing and restarting stalled replication forks, maintaining replication through highly repetitive regions of the genome, maintaining rDNA stability, elongating telomeres by ALT and controlling the topology of unusual DNA structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In contrast, little is known about the functions of SLF1 and SLF2, which were identified during a large proteomic screen of proteins associated with damaged replication forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, it has been suggested that SLF1 and SLF2 are functional orthologs of the yeast Nse5 and Nse6 proteins, respectively, which are important for localizing the SMC5/6 complex to DNA damage and regulating its ATPase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par37">Pursuant to the role of the SLF1/2-SMC5/6 complex in maintaining replication fork stability, we demonstrate that cells from ATS patients exhibit elevated levels of spontaneous replication stress, although this was not exacerbated significantly following exposure to replication stress-inducing agents (HU, MMC or APH). This suggests that the clinical phenotype resulting from variants in <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic> may not simply arise from elevated levels of replication stress, but rather from deficits with a subset of replication forks, such as those replicating through difficult-to-replicate regions of the genome or encountering specific types of endogenous DNA lesions. Consistent with this hypothesis, ATS cells fail to replicate efficiently in the presence of stabilized G4 structures and accumulate chromosomal damage, suggesting that the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway functions to resolve replication intermediates occurring at these lesions. Since G4 structures have been shown to be enriched at telomere repeat sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, a defect in the ability to replicate through these lesions could result in genome instability at telomeres, potentially explaining the presence of dicentric chromosomes in ATS patient cells.</p>
      <p id="Par38">ATS patients exhibit overlapping clinical and cellular features with WABS patients, including microcephaly, growth restriction, skin hyperpigmentation, ocular abnormalities and heart defects. Moreover, cell lines derived from both ATS and WABS patients exhibit loss of sister chromatid cohesion and premature chromatid separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the loss of sister chromatid cohesion in WABS cell lines is exacerbated upon exposure to replication stress-inducing genotoxins, including G4 stabilizing agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, cells from <italic>Ddx11</italic> null mice display loss of sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy, which has been shown to induce a G2/M cell cycle delay and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. This suggests that a failure to resolve specific endogenous DNA lesions, such as G4 structures, in ATS cells may directly compromise cohesion, or exacerbate a pre-existing cohesion defect, thus giving rise to chromosome segregation defects and aneuploidy that triggers cell death in highly proliferative tissues, such as the developing brain.</p>
      <p id="Par39">It is clear that the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway plays additional cellular roles beyond promoting replication through G4 lesions. In yeast, the smc5/6 complex restrains recombination at programmed fork pause sites, for example, in the rDNA locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and, in mammalian cells, SMC5/6 is involved in suppressing HR at highly repetitive sequences, e.g., rDNA, centromeres and telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, ATS cells exhibit elevated levels of RAD51 foci&#xA0;in S-phase cells and spontaneous SCEs and tSCEs. Interestingly, segmented chromosomes have been observed in cells that have a combined defect in both the Holliday junction dissolution and resolution pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, indicating that the gaps in the type 1 segmented chromosomes may result from a failure to dissolve/resolve recombination intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par40">Cells from <italic>NSMCE2</italic> and <italic>NSMCE3</italic> mutant patients are not known to display segmented or dicentric chromosomes, and whilst <italic>NSMCE3</italic> patient-derived cells exhibit aneuploidy and structural chromosome abnormalities, hyperploidy to the extent seen in ATS cells was not reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This indicates that neither NSMCE2 nor NSMCE3 subunits are essential for this SMC5/6 function, or that the hypomorphic variants in these genes retain sufficient function to suppress these chromosomal phenotypes. Consistent with the latter scenario, <italic>Nsmce2</italic> transgenic mice lacking SUMO E3 ligase activity developed normally, whereas a complete loss of <italic>Nsmce2</italic> resulted in early embryonic lethality associated with chromosome segregation defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Notably MEFs derived from the <italic>Nsmce2</italic> knockout mice exhibited increased spontaneous replication stress and genome instability due to a failure to detangle recombination intermediates similar to ATS patient cell lines (e.g., elevated levels of BRCA1 foci, increased sister chromatid and telomeric SCEs and chromosomal segregation errors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> indicating that ATS represents a more severe form of SMC5/6 dysfunction.</p>
      <p id="Par41">Interestingly, the clinical phenotype exhibited by patients with variants in the SMC5/6 complex components <italic>NSMCE2</italic> and <italic>NSMCE3</italic> are different from each other, with the former being associated with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and the latter being associated with severe pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It is unclear why these clinical presentations are different, especially as the cellular phenotype resulting from <italic>NSMCE2</italic> and <italic>NSMCE3</italic> variants are similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. One possible important cellular difference between the two disorders is that the patient-associated missense variants in <italic>NSMCE3</italic> result in the destabilization of the SMC5/6 complex to a much greater extent than the nonsense variants present in <italic>NSMCE2</italic> patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It is notable that the clinical phenotype of ATS patients more closely resembles that of <italic>NSMCE2</italic> patients than <italic>NSMCE3</italic> patients, and like <italic>NSMCE2</italic> patient variants, <italic>SLF2</italic> and <italic>SMC5</italic> patient variants do not destabilize the SMC5/6 complex to any significant degree.</p>
      <p id="Par42">Taken together, we have demonstrated that variants in two components of the RAD18-SLF1/2-SMC5/6 pathway give rise to a FA/MVA-like disorder, termed Atel&#xED;s Syndrome, with clinical and cellular features overlapping with WABS, MVA, NSMCE2 variants and FA. In vivo ablation of <italic>slf2</italic> and <italic>smc5</italic> in zebrafish recapitulate patient phenotypes including microcephaly and craniofacial patterning defects, likely due to concomitant cell cycle defects and apoptosis. We show that cells from ATS patients display a unique and complex chromosomal instability phenotype consisting of atelic (segmented) and dicentric chromosomes coupled with MVH, which should allow for cytogenetic diagnosis of patients with this disorder.</p>

        <p id="Par75">Pairs of SLF2 targeting guide RNAs (sgRNA 1, 5&#x2032;-AGTTTCATCACTCGGTTCCT-3&#x2032;; sgRNA 2, 5&#x2032;-GGCTTGGCACCTTCAAATTC-3&#x2032;) were designed using the CHOPCHOP web tool (version 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup> and hybridized and ligated into the purpose built AIO-GFP All-in-One Cas9D10A nickase vector at unique BbsI and BsaI sites. These constructs were transfected into U-2 OS cells using FuGENE transfection reagent according to manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions (3:1 ratio of FuGENE to DNA). Cells were sorted for high GFP expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into 96-well dishes and recovered in McCoys 5A media supplemented with 20% FBS and 5% penicillin-streptomycin. After 3 weeks, 25 colonies were chosen to be propagated and screened for successful gene editing. After propagating, potential clones were lysed in lysis butter (100&#x2009;mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 5&#x2009;mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200&#x2009;mM NaCl, 100 &#xB5;g Proteinase K/ml) and the DNA was precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in 10 mM Tris/HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. Screening of genomic DNA from clones was achieved by sequencing a region of SLF2 surrounding the Cas9 nickase cut sites (Reverse primer, 5&#x2032;-AGTTCCGATAATCCACCCCTT-3&#x2032;; Forward primer, 5&#x2032;-TTTCTGCAACCAGGTAGTCCT-3&#x2032;). Following secondary screening of five clones by Western blotting, two SLF2 CRISPR HM clones were chosen (renamed as cl.1 and cl.2) and were characterized further by inserting the amplified region of SLF2 described above into TOPO-TA vectors. 20 TOPO-TA vector clones were then sequenced for both cl.1 and cl.2 to identify all SLF2-mutant alleles and ensure no WT allele was present. The HM clones cl.1 and cl.2 were then complemented by 2xMyc-tagged SLF2 cloned into pLVX-IRES-neo (Takara Bio).</p>
