        <p id="Par1">SLITRK2 is a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed at postsynaptic neurons that regulates neurite outgrowth and excitatory synapse maintenance. In the present study, we report on rare variants (one nonsense and six missense variants) in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> on the X chromosome identified by exome sequencing in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Functional studies showed that some variants displayed impaired membrane transport and impaired excitatory synapse-promoting effects. Strikingly, these variations abolished the ability of SLITRK2 wild-type to reduce the levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in neurons. Moreover, <italic>Slitrk2</italic> conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and abnormal gait, recapitulating a subset of clinical features of patients with SLITRK2 variants. Furthermore, impaired excitatory synapse maintenance induced by hippocampal CA1-specific cKO of Slitrk2 caused abnormalities in spatial reference memory. Collectively, these data suggest that SLITRK2 is involved in X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders that are caused by perturbation of diverse facets of SLITRK2 function.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="Par3">Intellectual disability (ID) affects about 3% of the general population and is the most common reason for referral to genetic centers. It is estimated that at least half of cases have a monogenic cause, with more than 1000 genes corresponding to an equivalent number of rare diseases currently identified. The most frequently identified genes are responsible for at most 0.5% of cases. All modes of transmission&#x2014;autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked (dominant or recessive)&#x2014;are observed. Because of the disproportionate number of males among individuals with ID and the possibility of performing genetic studies of X-linked patterns of inheritance in large families, special attention has been paid to identifying the genetic basis of X-linked ID (XLID). Prior to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), major efforts by the EuroMRX consortium, the Sanger Center, and other international groups encompassing thousands of families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, led to the identification of a large number of XLID genes. The generalization of NGS approaches, including exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing has greatly accelerated the discovery of autosomal and XLID genes and increased the diagnostic yield of ID, resulting in a shortened diagnostic odyssey for families and expanded access to genetic counseling, including prenatal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Thus, there are now about ~130 identified XLID genes, with an additional ~50 potential candidate XLID genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. These include <italic>SLITRK2</italic>, a gene encoding a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in the brain.</p>
      <p id="Par4">Slit- and Trk-like family proteins, composed of six members (Slitrk1-6), are type I transmembrane proteins that are strongly expressed in the central nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, Slitrks positively regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapse development in cultured hippocampal neurons in a paralog-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Extensive analyses have shown that Slitrks interact with distinct members of the LAR-RPTP (leukocyte common antigen-related receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase) family to promote presynaptic assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, Slitrk5 interacts with receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in <italic>cis</italic> to regulate their interactions with LAR-RPTPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Structural analyses have further demonstrated that the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat 1 (LRR1) of Slitrks interacts with splicing variants of LAR-RPTPs that contain an insert at the MeB site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Divergent intracellular mechanisms of Slitrk2 and Slitrk3 also appear to be involved in their synaptic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, systematic analyses to investigate the effects of previously reported <italic>SLITRK</italic> missense variants revealed that a subset of <italic>SLITRK</italic> variants associated with neuropsychiatric disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> disrupt the trafficking of Slitrks to the cell surface and impair their synapse-promoting function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Collectively, these prior studies have established Slitrks as important synapse organizers.</p>
      <p id="Par5">The precise role of the Slitrk2 protein has not yet been clearly defined. The human <italic>SLITRK2</italic> gene is located on the X chromosome, and two missense variants, p. S549F and p.V89M, were reported to be associated with schizophrenia in two female patients who inherited the missense variants from their asymptomatic heterozygous mothers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SLITRK2 interacts with the PDZ domain-containing excitatory scaffold Shank3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, a gene associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD).</p>
      <p id="Par6">Here, we report that eight individuals from seven unrelated families with moderate to severe ID and/or NDDs, including neuropsychiatric and behavioral problems, harbor rare potential disease-causing variants of the X-linked gene, <italic>SLITRK2</italic>. We systemically investigated the effects of <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants on biochemical properties, surface transport, ligand-binding activity, and synaptogenic activities in cultured neurons. In addition, we analyzed the synaptic and behavioral effects of a Slitrk2 deficiency using <italic>Slitrk2</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice.</p>

        <title>Identification of individuals with rare variants i<italic>n SLITRK2</italic></title>
        <p id="Par7">Exome sequencing, used as a diagnostic approach in individual P1, identified a nonsense c.1381G&gt;T p.E461* variant in the <italic>SLITRK2</italic> gene (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Sanger sequencing confirmed that this variant was present in his affected brother (P2), but absent from mother&#x2019;s blood, suggesting a de novo occurrence in the maternal germ line (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Because the <italic>SLITRK2</italic> gene contains only one coding exon, we suspected that the mutant transcript does not undergo nonsense mRNA-mediated decay. Through an international data-sharing arrangement initiated through Genematcher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we identified six additional individuals with NDDs carrying rare nonsynonymous <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants predicted to be damaging. Among those were six missense variants&#x2014;c.221T&gt;C p.L74S (P7), c.628G&gt;A p.E210K (P10), c.934A&gt;G p.T312A (P3), c.1121C&gt;G p.P374R (P8), c.1276C&gt;T p.R426C (P4) and c.1531G&gt;A p.V511M (P5), all found in male individuals (except p.R426C)&#x2014;that were not previously reported in hemizygous state in gnomAD (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In all but one of these individuals, no other diagnostic candidate variants were identified during exome sequencing analyses. In P7, a likely pathogenic variant in the homeobox transcription factor <italic>ARX</italic> (c.1109C&gt;T p.A370V) was identified but this did not seem likely to fully explain the patient&#x2019;s phenotype, suggesting that the p.L74S variant identified in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> contributes to the observed symptoms. One variant (p.R426C) occurred de novo, and extended segregation analyses showed that one maternally inherited variant (p.P374R) occurred de novo in the unaffected mother.

        <title>Biochemical, structural, and ligand-binding phenotypes of disease-associated <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants</title>
        <p id="Par10">To investigate the structural effect of patient variants on human SLITRK2, we predicted the structure of SLITRK2 using AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Three variants (L74S, V201I, and E210K) are located in the LRR1 domain (aa C33-D270) and six variants (P374R, R426C, E461*, R484Q, V511M, and E555D) are located in the LRR2 domain (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, top). Free energy calculations indicated that three variants (L74S, P374R, and V511M) are predicted to affect the structural stability of the protein (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), possibly causing misfolding and aberrant trafficking. In particular, a point mutation in the nonpolar leucine, L74, to a polar serine residue in the consensus LxxLxLxxNxL motif of LRR1-1 is expected to disrupt hydrophobic interactions with neighboring nonpolar residues (V54, L69, L77, L91, and L93). Similarly, mutation of P374 to arginine is expected to disrupt the LRRNT hydrophobic core of LRR2, comprising with V357 and L380. A point mutation, resulting in the replacement of a small, nonpolar valine by a long methionine (V511M), may collapse LRRCT folding of the LRR2 domain. The crystal structure of the human SLITRK1 LRR1 domain in complex with PTP&#x3B4; Ig1-3 has shown that E206 on the concave surface of SLITRK1 makes ionic interactions with the side chain of K135 and main chain of V136<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Mutation of SLITRK2 E210 corresponding to SLITRK1 E206 to positively charged lysine would be expected cause charge repulsion, thus interrupting the interaction of SLITRK2 LRR1 with LAR-RPTPs. Because cysteine residues are usually undesirable in exposed regions of a protein unless they acquire functions such as metal binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the R426C variant on the concave surface may adversely affect protein stability. However, other variants exposed on the surface (E461*, R484Q, and E555D in LRR2) and V201I, which form hydrophobic networks in LRR1, are predicted to have little effect on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of SLITRK2.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Structural model of human SLITRK2 and patient variants.</title><p>Model structure of human SLITRK2 LRR1 and LRR2 domains presented as a cartoon.

        <p id="Par11">To further investigate the impact of amino acid substitutions on the structure and/or synaptic function of SLITRK2, we generated mammalian expression vectors encoding <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants identified in individuals with NDD, both those considered potentially disease-causing and those identified in gnomAD (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref> and Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). As controls, in addition to the V201I variant, we included two other variants&#x2014;c.967A&gt;G p.S323N and c.1765G&gt;A p.V589I&#x2014;present in 6 and 139 males from gnomAD respectively and therefore presumed to be benign (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Notably, P374 and V511 residues in human SLITRK2 are conserved in other human SLITRK proteins at equivalent positions, but none of the other residues exhibit complete sequence identity across the six SLITRK members (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). The two variants from Decipher, S9I and G15E, are located in the signal peptide of SLITRK2, which is expected to be cleaved after membrane targeting. Thus, for these two variants, we generated pCMV5-SLITRK2 vector harboring its own signal peptide, whereas the other variants were generated using the pDisplay-SLITRK2 vector (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Most of these residues are quite evolutionarily conserved among various vertebrate species, implying their possible functional significance (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Impaired surface trafficking of a subset of SLITRK2 variants.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagrams depicting the <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants analyzed in the current study. <bold>b</bold> Representative immunoblots from HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated WT or mutant forms of SLITRK2.

        <p id="Par12">We then examined the expression levels and intracellular transport properties of the various SLITRK2 variants following expression in human embryonic kidney 293&#x2009;T (HEK293T) cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Immunoblot analyses of lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with vectors encoding HA-tagged full-length SLITRK2 wild-type (WT) or the respective variants showed that total protein expression levels of all SLITRK2 point mutants (except E461*) were comparable to those of SLITRK2 WT (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The E461* variant, which resulted in a premature termination codon, yielded a truncated protein of ~60&#x2009;kDa in SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Notably, unlike SLITRK2 WT, which is expressed as both N-glycosylated and non-glycosylated protein species, three SLITRK2 variants (L74S, P374R, and R426C) in HEK293T cells were detected as immature, non-glycosylated forms (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We next examined the surface and intracellular protein levels of SLITRK2 WT and the indicated SLITRK2 variants in HEK293T cells (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). In keeping with the glycosylation profiles (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), only three SLITRK2 variants (L74S, P374R, and R426C) displayed significantly reduced surface levels, reflecting their complete entrapment in an intracellular compartment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>), in the absence of altered cellular membrane integrity (as monitored by transferrin receptor expression; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The E461* variant also exhibited reduced surface levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>), in agreement with the absence of a transmembrane region in this variant; thus, this truncated SLITRK2 is likely secreted (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Results obtained using surface biotinylation assays were consistent with these findings, showing markedly lower surface expression levels of L74S, P374R, R426C, and E461* variants (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Note that, although S9I and G15E variants are located in the SLITRK2 signal peptide, they did not affect the membrane transport of SLITRK2 (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par13">To determine whether the various <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants affected the interactions with PTP&#x3B4;, an extracellular ligand of SLITRK2, we assayed cell-surface binding of recombinant Ig-fusion proteins of PTP&#x3B4; (IgC-PTP&#x3B4;) or IgC alone (negative control) with HEK293T cells expressing HA-tagged SLITRK2 variants (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). IgC-PTP&#x3B4; proteins avidly bound to HEK293T cells expressing SLITRK2 variants, except those expressing a subset of SLITRK2 variants with defective surface transport properties (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). IgC did not bind to any tested SLITRK2 variants (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par14">To ensure that the subset of the SLITRK2 variants with impaired surface transport properties exhibited similar trafficking defects in neurons, we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with WT or variant SLITRK2 and analyzed them by immunocytochemistry. Whereas most HA-tagged SLITRK2 variants were transported into dendrites as efficiently as SLITRK2 WT (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), three SLITRK2 variants (L74S, P374R, and R426C) were either completely retained in the cell body of transfected neurons, or displayed markedly impaired trafficking into dendrites (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), as judged relative to immunofluorescence signals in the somatic compartment of transfected neurons. Puzzlingly, HA immunoreactive intensity in the somatic compartment was not decreased in neurons transfected with L74S, P374R, or R426C (see Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), possibly reflecting imprecise evaluation owing to saturation of HA immunoreactivity in transfected neurons. We thus repeated the same experiments using a subset of SLITRK2 variants and quantified HA immunoreactive intensity in transfected neurons imaged using settings that prevented saturation of immunofluorescence signals (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a, b</xref>). We found that HA immunoreactivity was significantly increased in somatic compartments of neurons expressing L74S or P374R, but not in those of neurons expressing R426C (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8a, b</xref>). Similar findings were also obtained using Slitrk2-deficient cultured neurons (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). These findings are also consistent with the slight increase in R426C entrapment in an intracellular compartment (i.e., <italic>cis</italic>-golgi) of cultured neurons, as assessed by its colocalization with anti-GM130 (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). No alterations in dendritic branching were observed in neurons expressing SLITRK2 WT or the indicated SLITRK2 variants (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8c</xref>). The E461* variant also exhibited impaired dendritic trafficking and reduced levels of HA immunofluorescence signals in the somatic compartment (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), in agreement with the absence of a transmembrane region; in E461*, again suggesting that the truncated SLITRK2 protein is likely secreted. These observations suggest that the surface transport deficiency observed in heterologous cells is similarly recapitulated in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, these data suggest that one subset of SLITRK2 variants observed in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders causes improper biochemical processing and abnormal trafficking.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Impaired dendritic targeting of a subset of SLITRK2 variants in cultured hippocampal neurons.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative images of hippocampal neurons transfected with the indicated WT or mutant forms of SLITRK2 at DIV10.

        <p id="Par17">Slitrk2 was previously shown to specifically promote excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse maintenance in cultured neurons and hippocampal CA1 neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To address this, we first examined whether Slitrk2 deletion induced a specific decrease in excitatory synapse numbers and synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons. Immunostaining neurons at DIV14 with antibodies to VGLUT1 and SHANK, markers for excitatory postsynaptic density, revealed a reduction in the density of excitatory synaptic puncta immunoreactive to both VGLUT1 and SHANK (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a, b</xref>). As expected, neither the density nor size of inhibitory synaptic puncta was changed in neurons immunostained with antibodies to VGAT and GABA<sub>A</sub>&#x3B3;2, an inhibitory postsynaptic marker (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14a, b, d</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par18">To assess whether the potential disease-causing SLITRK2 variants affect the excitatory synapse-promoting function of SLITRK2 WT, we infected cultured hippocampal <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO neurons with lentiviruses expressing either inactive Cre (&#x394;Cre; Control) or active Cre recombinase at DIV5 and co-transfected them with human SLITRK2 expression variants and EGFP at DIV8&#x2013;9. We subsequently immunostained these infected/co-transfected neurons with antibodies to synaptophysin, SHANK and EGFP (to visualize the transfected neurons) at DIV13&#x2013;14. The density, but not the size, of excitatory synaptic puncta immunoreactive to both synaptophysin and SHANK was significantly reduced in <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-deficient neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14e</xref>). Co-expression of SLITRK2 WT completely reversed the excitatory synaptic deficits observed in <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-deficient neurons (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>).

        <title>Reduced TrkB levels induced by SLITRK2 WT, but not by disease-associated SLITRK2 variants</title>
        <p id="Par20">Previous studies have shown that SLITRK5 acts as a co-receptor for TrkB that orchestrates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TrkB-dependent trafficking and signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, and that an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-associated <italic>SLITRK5</italic> missense variant impairs SLITRK5 binding to TrkB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, we next analyzed whether the identified <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants also altered TrkB binding, assessed by coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells. We found that disease-linked <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants with impaired excitatory synapse maintenance did not affect the ability of SLITRK2 to bind TrkB (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17a, b</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par21">BDNF plays critical roles in neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity through activation of a full-length receptor (TrkB-FL) while truncated TrkB isoforms (TrkB-T) are presumed to competitively inhibit BDNF-mediated TrkB signaling in certain contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Excitotoxic stimulation of cultured neurons with glutamate downregulated TrkB-FL, resulting in downregulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, calpain activation triggers the truncation of TrkB-FL, leading to downregulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that disease-linked <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants could alter BDNF-TrkB signaling. To test this possibility, we infected DIV3 cortical cultured neurons with lentiviruses expressing SLITRK2 WT or the indicated variants, and collected the infected neuronal lysates at DIV14. Immunoblot analyses revealed that overexpression of SLITRK2 WT significantly decreased TrkB-FL levels, but markedly increased TrkB-T levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>), suggesting that SLITRK2 might reduce forward trafficking of TrkB and/or trigger the truncation of TrkB-FL. Strikingly, T312A abolished the ability of SLITRK2 WT to decrease TrkB-FL levels (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). In addition, the effects of L74S, P374R, R426C, or E461* were similar to those of T312A (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>).

        <p id="Par23">We then tested whether <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO mice exhibited the behavioral features that manifest in patients with NDD and <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants (see Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To this end, we performed a battery of behavioral tests, including those measuring learning and memory, locomotion, anxiety, and motor coordination (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18</xref>). Ten-week-old male Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice displayed comparable exploratory behavior (assessed by open-field tests) (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18a, b</xref>), sociability, and social novelty recognition memory (assessed by three-chamber tests) as littermate control mice, showing preference for the first novel mouse over an inanimate object (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18c, d</xref>) and preference for a novel stranger mouse over familiar mouse (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18e, f</xref>). However, Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior, as evidenced by increased time spent in open arms (with a similar number of entries into each open arm) in the elevated plus-maze test, without a change in time spent in the light compartment in the light-dark test (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18g&#x2013;i</xref>). Moreover, Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice showed impaired spatial learning and memory (assessed by novel object-recognition tests), although spontaneous alternation in Y-maze tests was similar to that of littermate control mice (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18j&#x2013;m</xref>). We further examined spatial reference memory, as evaluated by the Barnes maze test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Both Control and Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice learned to locate the target hole during the course of the training period, as indicated by gradual reductions in the number of search errors, escape latency and total distance traveled, indicating normal acquisition of spatial reference memory in Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a&#x2013;d</xref>). We then conducted the first probe test 3 days after the last day of training and the second probe test after 17 days. In the first probe test, the number of search errors was comparable between Control and Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e</xref>). In contrast, the accuracy of spatial memory of Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice in the second probe tests was worse than that of control mice, suggesting that retention of spatial reference memory is impaired in Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8f</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title><italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO mice display mild learning and memory deficits and abnormal gait.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic depiction (top) of Barnes maze test. <bold>b</bold>&#x2013;<bold>d</bold> Number of errors before first encountering the escape hole (<bold>b</bold>) escape latency (<bold>c</bold>) and total distance (<bold>d</bold>) for Control and Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice during the training session.

        <p id="Par24">Because some NDD patients reported in the current study suffer from spasticity and/or dystonia and unsteady gait (Table&#xA0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we also examined whether Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice exhibit deficits in fine motor coordination. To this end, we analyzed the juvenile (P20) and adult (P65) Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice by measuring overlap distance, stance width, step angle, and gait symmetry. At both ages, the mean stride length, stance length, and sway length of forelimbs and hindlimbs of Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice were comparable to those of control littermate mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8g&#x2013;i</xref>).

        <title>Correlation of impaired hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapse properties of <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO mice with deficits in spatial reference memory</title>
        <p id="Par25">Because Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice exhibited impairment in the Barnes maze test (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a&#x2013;f</xref>), a hippocampal CA1-dependent spatial task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we asked whether loss of Slitrk2 in the hippocampal CA1 region could recapitulate this behavioral deficit. To this end, we stereotactically injected adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) expressing Cre or &#x394;Cre (Ctrl) into the CA1 of adult Slitrk2-floxed mice and performed semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings three weeks after injections (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, b</xref>). We found that the frequency, but not amplitude, of mEPSCs was markedly decreased in hippocampal CA1-specific <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO mice (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c&#x2013;e</xref>). Moreover, these mice exhibited a significant reduction in the integrated intensity of VGLUT1 and PSD-95 puncta in the SO and SR layers (Fig.&#xA0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9f, g</xref>), without changes in VGAT puncta in any examined hippocampal CA1 layer (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19</xref>), in keeping with the anatomical phenotype of Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par27">Although numerous genes encoding synaptic cell adhesion proteins (CAMs) have been identified as causative factors for a variety of neurodevelopmental and/or neuropsychiatric disorders, it had remained to be determined whether a subset of neurological symptoms of patients with these disorders are caused by alterations in synaptic adhesion signaling pathways that are not clearly established. As a member of a vertebrate-specific synaptic cell adhesion protein family, SLITRK2 specifically functions in mediating proper excitatory synapse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In particular, SLITRK2 is required for organizing <italic>trans</italic>-synaptic signaling pathways involved in excitatory presynaptic assembly and postsynaptic maintenance by binding to PTP&#x3C3; and PDZ domain-containing scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In addition, our previous study demonstrated that a subset of disease-associated SLITRK2 missense variants induce impaired dendritic targeting of Slitrk2 in neurons, leading to dysfunctions of excitatory synapse maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The SLITRK2 V89M variant reduced excitatory synapse density, likely through its deleterious effects on surface expression and dendritic targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, a series of other SLITRK variants associated with Tourette&#x2019;s syndrome, trichotillomania, schizophrenia, or OCD was shown to trigger loss of the respective SLITRK protein functions in cultured hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These results collectively suggest that pathogenic <italic>SLITRK</italic> genetic variants likely induce loss-of-function of corresponding SLITRKs, accounting for the pathogenesis of patients with neurological disorders. However, previous studies, which primarily employed knockdown (KD) and/or overexpression approaches, preclude firm conclusions about SLITRK2 functions. Previous Slitrk2 loss-of-function studies performed in cultured neurons and mice produced contradictory results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, with Slitrk2 KD in cultured neurons reducing excitatory synapse density, and Slitrk2 KD in hippocampal CA1 neurons failing to affect excitatory synapse density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These results were previously attributed to differences in genetic manipulations, cellular preparation, or other unknown factor(s). Extensive analyses using <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-cKO mouse-derived cultured neurons recapitulated our previous anatomical results using Slitrk2 KD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, in addition to exhibiting marked reduction in excitatory synaptic transmission. Moreover, <italic>Slitrk2</italic> deletion in adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons similarly reduces the frequency of mEPSCs, in contrast to the absence of an effect of global Slitrk2 KD on mEPSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These results again underscore the importance of confirmatory analyses using a sophisticated system and approaches to elucidate functions of synaptic proteins.</p>
      <p id="Par28">In the current study, we identified <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants in NDD characterized by developmental delay and speech delay, mild to severe ID, and various neurological and behavioral comorbidities. Seven of the eight individuals with potential disease-causing variants had significant anxiety, and four patients were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Other behavioral diagnoses include ADHD with executive difficulties, hyperactivity, or agitation. Several individuals had unsteady gait associated with spasticity and/or dystonia and three patients had seizures, of variable type, with the severity of ID ranging from mild to severe. Such clinical heterogeneity among individuals is often reported in NDDs associated with mutations in the same gene and even precisely the same mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that other genetic and/or environmental modifying factors might also be involved. <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants have previously been reported in two females with schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but no patients affected by ID and/or NDD phenotypes and carrying <italic>SLITRK2</italic> pathogenic variants have been reported to date. Of the seven potential disease-causing variants identified in this study, five induced prominent alterations in the properties of SLITRK2. Among these, three variants (L74S, P374R, and R426C) perturbed surface transport of SLITRK2, accompanied by impaired binding to LAR-RPTPs and synaptogenic activity, similar to most of known <italic>SLITRK1/4/5</italic> substitutions that represent loss-of-function mutations. One variant (E461*) in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> was a nonsense variant, and resulted therefore in a truncated SLITRK2 protein. The fifth variant, T312A, induced normal surface expression, and normal extracellular ligand-binding and synaptogenic activity, albeit with markedly reduced excitatory synapse number and excitatory synaptic transmission. Remarkably, these five SLITRK2 variants abrogated the ability of SLITRK2 WT to negatively regulate TrkB-FL levels in neurons, revealing the significance of interactions between SLITRK2 and TrkB in terms of preventing SLITRK2 dysfunction-induced pathogenic effects. Given the well-established centrality of TrkB-mediated signaling in excitatory synapse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, it is plausible that selection of specific binding partners (i.e., LAR-RPTPs vs. TrkB) through fine regulation of SLITRK2-mediated extracellular interactions constitutes an important signaling pathway for excitatory synapse organization. Our preliminary analyses suggested that Slitrk2, Slitrk3, and Slitrk5, but not other Slitrks, bind to TrkB (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>). Further experiments are warranted to dissect the molecular determinants underlying Slitrk2/5-TrkB interactions.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Our extensive behavioral analyses showed that Slitrk2 loss-of-functions in mice recapitulated a subset of behavioral symptoms found in patients with <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants. Strikingly, the current study demonstrated that selective elimination of Slitrk2 expression in the hippocampal CA1 results in impaired retention of spatial reference memory. It is likely that specific alterations in synaptic inputs on CA1 neurons, possibly from either entorhinal cortex afferents or CA3 Schaffer-collateral afferents, are responsible for abnormalities in this behavioral task. Whether SLITRK2 is involved in the assembly of specific hippocampal circuits remains to be determined. In addition, Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and altered footprint patterns. However, these mice displayed normal grip strength and somewhat enhanced motor coordination and learning. In general, the cerebellum is critical for coordinating movements, and its dysfunction often leads to uncoordinated walking or gait disturbance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, a feature of patients harboring a subset of SLITRK2 variants, even though they were not clearly ataxic and the brain MRI did not show cerebellar anomalies (except for one patient with severe cerebral and cerebellar volume loss). Although the current study primarily correlated SLITRK2 synaptic functions in the hippocampal CA1 with spatial memory performance, future studies are warranted to identify the neuronal populations and/or neural circuits embedded in other brain areas that might underpin abnormal footprint patterns seen in Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice. Moreover, most patients harboring potential disease-causing variants in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> are anxious, whereas Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice appeared to exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze tests. Future studies utilizing knock-in mice expressing disease-associated SLITRK2 variants should help resolve this issue using additional behavioral paradigms that examine anxiety-like behavior. Most patients exhibit seizures and speech delay. Thus, it will be necessary to clarify whether Nestin-<italic>Slitrk2</italic> mice exhibit seizure-like phenotypes or communication deficits by measuring electroencephalography and measuring ultrasonic vocalization, respectively. Because our various analyses did not reveal any prominent phenotypes in the case of E210K and V511M (predicted to be deleterious by in silico programs), their pathogenicity remains uncertain, although it is still possible that these variants are involved in SLITRK2-associated pathophysiology via as-yet unidentified mechanism(s) encompassing early brain developmental processes. Given that Slitrk2 is also expressed in specific astrocytic subtypes in adult mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, it is reasonable to speculate that these <italic>SLITRK2</italic> missense variants with no clear phenotypes in current functional assays might affect specific aspects of astrocytic functions that remain to be determined.</p>
      <p id="Par30">In conclusion, we demonstrated nonsense and missense variants in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> in a novel form of X-linked NDD characterized by different degrees of ID associated with motor, speech, and behavioral impairments, that are caused by perturbation of SLITRK2 function. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm the involvement of this gene in a NDD and better delineate the clinical manifestations of the latter, especially at the behavioral level.</p>

For immunocytochemistry, cultured rat neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% sucrose in PBS for 30&#x2009;min at 4&#x2009;&#xB0;C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30&#x2009;min at 4&#x2009;&#xB0;C. Neurons were then blocked by incubating with 3% horse serum/0.1% BSA in PBS for 15&#x2009;min at room temperature, then stained with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies for 70&#x2009;min at room temperature. Z-stack images of randomly selected neurons were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM780; Carl Zeiss) with a &#xD7;63 objective lens. Obtained Z-stack images were converted to maximal projections, and colocalized puncta densities were analyzed in a blinded manner using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp.).</p>

The hole above the escape box represented the target. The location of the target was consistent for a given mouse but randomized across mice. The maze was rotated daily, with the spatial location of the target unchanged with respect to the distal visual room cues, to prevent a bias based on olfactory or proximal cues within the maze. Three trials per day were conducted for 7 successive days. On day 10, the first probe trial was conducted without the escape box to confirm that the spatial task was acquired based on navigation by distal environment room cues. On day 17, the second probe trial was conducted. During acquisition and probe trials, the following parameters were measured by a top-view infrared camera and analyzed using EthoVision XT 10.5 (Noldus): velocity, error score, total distance, first visit time to escape box, and total latency.</p>
