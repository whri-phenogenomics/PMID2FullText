      <abstract>
        <p>RNA polymerase III (Pol III) synthesizes tRNAs and other small noncoding RNAs to regulate protein synthesis. Dysregulation of Pol III transcription has been linked to cancer, and germline mutations in genes encoding Pol III subunits or tRNA processing factors cause neurogenetic disorders in humans, such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophies and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Here we describe an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and intellectual disability, as well as facial dysmorphic features, short stature, microcephaly, and dental anomalies. Whole-exome sequencing revealed biallelic missense alterations of <italic>BRF1</italic> in three families. In support of the pathogenic potential of the discovered alleles, suppression or CRISPR-mediated deletion of <italic>brf1</italic> in zebrafish embryos recapitulated key neurodevelopmental phenotypes; in vivo complementation showed all four candidate mutations to be pathogenic in an apparent isoform-specific context. BRF1 associates with BDP1 and TBP to form the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB), which recruits Pol III to target genes. We show that disease-causing mutations reduce Brf1 occupancy at tRNA target genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and impair cell growth. Moreover, <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations reduce Pol III&#x2013;related transcription activity in vitro. Taken together, our data show that <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations that reduce protein activity cause neurodevelopmental anomalies, suggesting that BRF1-mediated Pol III transcription is required for normal cerebellar and cognitive development.</p>

  <body><p>Three RNA polymerases synthesize the different classes of RNAs in eukaryotic cells. Pol I synthesizes most ribosomal RNAs; Pol II mRNAs and miRNAs; and Pol III a variety of noncoding RNAs with a structural and catalytic function, e.g., tRNAs, 7SK RNA, 5S rRNA, and U6 snRNA (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Schramm and Hernandez 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">White 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dieci et al. 2013</xref>). Pol II&#x2013;dependent transcription has attracted most attention because its mRNA products are protein coding, but recent years have seen an increasing interest in Pol III transcription, not least because of its implication in human disorders. Increased Pol III&#x2013;dependent transcription has been linked to cell transformation and cancer (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Marshall and White 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cabarcas and Schramm 2011</xref>), and germline mutations in components of the Pol III or tRNA processing machinery have been associated with neurogenetic disorders, such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a heterogeneous group of severe, often lethal, progressive neurodegenerative conditions characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, progressive microcephaly, seizures, and profound developmental impairment. At least 10 types of PCH are currently recognized, and mutations causing the most prevalent subtypes, PCH2 and PCH4, are predicted to lead to loss of function of tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN); other PCH types display anomalies of tRNA processing as well (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Namavar et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Akizu et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rudnik-Sch&#xF6;neborn et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schaffer et al. 2014</xref>). However, the pathomechanism leading to PCH is poorly understood in many subtypes.</p><p>More recently, mutations in the catalytic Pol III subunits POLR3A and POLR3B have been identified in syndromic hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, such as hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (4H syndrome) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bernard et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saitsu et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Tetreault et al. 2011</xref>). <italic>POLR3A</italic> mutations lead to a decrease in POLR3A levels and are predicted to interfere with the interaction with other Pol III subunits, which in turn would perturb Pol III&#x2013;mediated transcription; a similar mechanism has been postulated for POLR3B-associated leukodystrophies. Although the molecular pathophysiology of these diseases is not fully understood, these findings suggest that an intact Pol III apparatus is essential for cognitive development and the structural and functional integrity of the cerebellum and white matter.</p><p>The basal Pol III transcription machinery requires the orchestrated interaction of Pol III, a multiprotein enzyme consisting of 17 polypeptide subunits, TFIIIB (transcription factor IIIB), and TFIIIC (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">White 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vannini and Cramer 2012</xref>). These factors, as well as the underlying mechanisms of transcription initiation, are conserved in eukaryotes. TFIIIC recognizes and binds to specific sequence blocks in internal promoters (type 1 and 2 promoters) of target genes, such as tRNA genes. TFIIIC then recruits TFIIIB, which is usually composed of the B-related factor BRF1, B double prime 1 BDP1, and the TATA box-binding protein TBP, each of which is required for TFIIIB function in vitro (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">White 2011</xref>). TFIIIB recruits Pol III for transcription initiation. For the transcription of human RNA genes with external (type 3) promoters, such as U6 snRNA, BRF1 is replaced by BRF2 in TFIIIB, and TFIIIC is not required (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Schramm and Hernandez 2002</xref>). Notably, <italic>TBP</italic> is a candidate gene for cognitive disorders in humans (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Rooms et al. 2006</xref>), and TBP polyglutamine expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe an autosomal recessive human syndrome characterized by intellectual disability and cerebellar, dental, and skeletal anomalies. We used whole-exome sequencing (WES) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bamshad et al. 2011</xref>) and in vivo and in vitro assays to provide evidence that partial loss-of-function <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations cause this recognizable disease by impairing Pol III&#x2013;mediated transcription.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Clinical delineation of a cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome</title><p>By comparing the clinical features of three pairs of siblings (three female and three male) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A&#x2013;C</xref>) from three unrelated families, we observed a striking clinical overlap pointing to a previously undescribed disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, and dental anomalies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; for the complete version of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, see Supplemental Material). In each of the three families, two affected children were born to unaffected parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. In family 3 with first-cousin parents, Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) segregated independently from cerebellar hypoplasia in two siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The six children affected by the cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome showed similar dysmorphic features that included sparse eyebrows, wave-shaped palpebral fissures, apparently low-set ears, malocclusion, and prominent upper incisors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). They had proportionate short stature and microcephaly of prenatal onset, mild-to-severe intellectual disability with speech delay, scoliosis, and sparse hair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Three children had laryngeal stridor or laryngomalacia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pattern that was reminiscent of TSEN-related PCH, with a very thin corpus callosum, a flattened brainstem, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia; however, the pons was relatively well formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). On skull and orthopanoramic x-rays, we saw bialveolar protrusion with prominent alveolar processes as well as taurodontism, a specific malformation of the pulp of molar teeth. Array-CGH did not detect causative copy number variants. We refer to this syndrome as cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>BRF1</italic> mutations cause a cerebellar-dental-skeletal syndrome.

Under the simplest assumption of genetic homogeneity for this rare autosomal recessive phenotypic constellation, we filtered for variants in the same gene with a predicted impact on protein function or RNA splicing that are rare in control populations of European descent. Because of parental consanguinity in family 3 and the lack of consanguinity in families 1 and 2, we searched for a gene harboring a rare homozygous variant in the affected individuals from family 3 and rare compound heterozygous (or homozygous) variants in the affected children in families 1 and 2. Subsequent to WES analysis and filtering, there was a single gene that contained biallelic mutations in all affected children: <italic>BRF1</italic>. Each affected child had two variants that predicted missense alterations, for a total of four distinct mutations. We confirmed all four <italic>BRF1</italic> alleles, as well as cosegregation with the cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome, in each family by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>; Supplemental Fig. 1). In family 1, the affected siblings were compound heterozygous for a maternally inherited c.677C &gt; T mutation and a paternally inherited c.776C &gt; T mutation, predicting p.Ser226Leu (S226L) and p.Thr259Met (T259M), respectively. In family 2, the affected sisters had inherited a c.667C &gt; T mutation from their mother and carried a c.875C &gt; A mutation that was likely transmitted from their father, from whom no DNA was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). These mutations predict p.Arg223Trp (R223W) and p.Pro292His (P292H) missense alterations, respectively. The two affected boys in family 3 were homozygous for the c.677C &gt; T (p.Ser226Leu) mutation that had been identified in family 1. This mutation cosegregated with the cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome in family 3, while LCA was caused by a homozygous mutation in <italic>RDH12</italic> (c.784dupG; p.Ala262Glyfs*11), a gene previously shown to be mutated in LCA (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Janecke et al. 2004</xref>). The four <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations were absent from ethnically matched controls as shown by sequencing and were not present or very rare in public SNP databases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p><italic>BRF1</italic> mutations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="155tbl2"/></table-wrap><p>The longest BRF1 isoform is a 677-amino-acid protein that, together with TBP and BDP1, forms the transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB), which recruits Pol III to its templates and is involved in promoter opening (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">White 2011</xref>). The N-terminal region of BRF1 has a role in DNA binding and Pol III recruitment (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kassavetis et al. 1998</xref>), is homologous to the Pol II transcription factor TFIIB, and contains an N-terminal zinc ribbon domain and two cyclin domains (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Khoo et al. 2014</xref>). The <italic>BRF1</italic> gene on human chromosome 14q32.33 encodes several functional isoforms, some of which lack the zinc ribbon domain (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McCulloch et al. 2000</xref>). The four identified missense alterations invariably affect amino acids that are evolutionarily conserved, including in orthologs from mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), but are not conserved in BRF2. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Brf1 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Colbert and Hahn 1992</xref>), Arg223, Thr259, and Pro292 are conserved, whereas Ser226 is replaced conservatively by an alanine; for clarity, we will use the human amino acid numbering henceforth.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of <italic>brf1</italic> in zebrafish</title><p>As a first test of the functional candidacy of <italic>BRF1</italic>, we sought an in vivo model with a credible phenotypic surrogate. We noted that all probands in our study have cerebellar hypoplasia and microcephaly, both of which have been modeled previously in zebrafish embryos for a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Golzio et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dauber et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Margolin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Bernier et al. 2014</xref>). We therefore turned to developing zebrafish embryos and asked whether either suppression or overexpression of <italic>brf1</italic> has an effect on neurogenesis, head size, and/or cerebellar morphology.</p><p>Given that <italic>brf1</italic> has two copies in the zebrafish genome due to the teleost-specific genome duplication, we generated splice blocking morpholinos (sbMOs) for both copies (<italic>brf1a</italic> and <italic>brf1b</italic>), and we scored for neurogenesis by measuring the area of the optic tectum, the area between the eyes as a surrogate for brain size, and the cerebellar integrity. We note that while <italic>brf1a</italic> is known to be expressed at multiple stages of development as well as in multiple organs, little is known about <italic>brf1b</italic> in zebrafish. Our in-house RNA-seq data that interrogate the transcripts expressed specifically in the head of 5 d post fertilization (d.p.f.) zebrafish embryos indicated that <italic>brf1b</italic> has significantly increased expression when compared to <italic>brf1a</italic>. Indeed, <italic>brf1b</italic> was expressed, on average, 11.59 CPM (counts per million mapped reads), while <italic>brf1a</italic> expression was 4.32 CPM. In triplicate experiments scored by two investigators masked to the injection cocktails, suppression of <italic>brf1a</italic> gave no appreciable phenotypes (data not shown). In contrast, suppression of <italic>brf1b</italic> with a MO against the donor site of exon 8 (MO#1) (Supplemental Fig. 2) resulted in a significant reduction of both the size of the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B&#x2032;,D,F&#x2032;,H</xref>) and the total area between the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C,F,G</xref>). Furthermore, we observed cerebellar hypoplasia as determined by the lack of axons in the midline of the morphant zebrafish cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B&#x2032;,F&#x2032;,I</xref>). We did not observe further overt morphological abnormalities or developmental delay in the injected embryos as judged by the shape and position of the heart, the absence of edema, the number and shape of somites, and the presence of a normal swim bladder. The observed phenotypes were specific; coinjection of MO and wild-type (WT) human mRNA was able to rescue the phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B&#x2013;D,F&#x2013;I</xref>). To assess the functionality of the alleles, we coinjected MO with human mRNA bearing one of the variants of interest (P292H, R223W, S226L, and T259M) at a time. In the context of BRF1 isoform 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), P292H and R223W scored as functionally nulls as they failed to rescue the reduction in head size and optic tecta as well as the cerebellar hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F&#x2013;I</xref>), while S226L and T259M scored as hypomorphic: The mutants were significantly more affected than MO + WT but not as severe as MO alone. Strikingly, testing of three of the alleles (R223W, S226L, T259M) in isoform 1 showed them all to be benign (rescue was indistinguishable from WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A&#x2013;D</xref>), suggesting that the effect of the mutations is isoform specific. Overexpression of WT human <italic>BRF1</italic> and human P292H, R223W, S226L, or T259M <italic>BRF1</italic> showed no difference in head size, optic tecta, or cerebellar hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G&#x2032;,H&#x2032;,I&#x2032;</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Functional annotation of variants in isoforms 1 and 2 of BRF1 and its effects on the head size, optic tectum size, and cerebellar formation in zebrafish embryos.

In the context of isoform 2, functional analysis using zebrafish show that P292H and R223W are null, while S226L and T259M are hypomorphic alleles, showing an isoform-specific effect in which head size and optic tecta size are reduced and cerebellar disorganization occurs.

Some examples include pontocerebellar hypoplasias, Pol III&#x2013;related leukodystrophies, X-linked intellectual disability, and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bugiani et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Namavar et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Borck et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Daoud et al. 2013</xref>). Complete inactivation of processes such as translation initiation or tRNA transcription is not compatible with life, suggesting that most disease-causing mutations are hypomorphs.</p><p>Our identification and characterization of <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations causing the syndromic cerebellar-facial-dental phenotype is in line with these observations. No mutant <italic>Brf1</italic> mouse has been reported to our knowledge; in yeast, deletion of <italic>BRF1</italic> is lethal (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Colbert and Hahn 1992</xref>). Accordingly, one of the missense variants we have identified is recruited to a lesser extent than wild type to target genes. Several other mutants have reduced transcriptional activity, suggesting that in the context of this assay they behave as hypomorphs. <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations likely confer a specific phenotype; we did not identify <italic>BRF1</italic> mutations in three individuals with clinically overlapping but distinct malformation syndromes or in seven individuals with genetically unresolved forms of PCH (data not shown). However, there is compelling evidence for the pathogenicity of the identified variants in the cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome: <italic>BRF1</italic> was the only gene exome-wide that harbored very rare or unique biallelic mutations in the three affected sibships. These missense variants affect conserved amino acids that lie within a predicted functional domain, and two of the affected amino acids likely interact directly with DNA. In vivo experiments in zebrafish embryos showed that suppression of <italic>brf1b</italic> phenocopied some of the key pathognomonic features of the syndrome. Of note, while we cannot exclude a possible effect of overexpression on the outcome of our zebrafish assays, the effects of the variants seemed to be restricted to isoform 2 of BRF1. Thus our results possibly illustrate an isoform-specific effect underlying the phenotype and offer a plausible hypothesis about how mutations in a ubiquitous, key component of the cellular machinery can induce specific, albeit severe, phenotypes. Similar splice isoform-specific pathogenic effects have been found in other disorders (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Sarparanta et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Schulte et al. 2014</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism might be a significant regulator of pleiotropy. Previous studies have shown that full-length human BRF1 is the canonical isoform in pol III transcription, and whether other isoforms, including isoforms lacking the evolutionary conserved Zn ribbon domain such as isoform 2, are biologically active remains unknown. Biochemical data indicate that overexpression of isoforms lacking the Zn ribbon domain can induce BRF1&#x2013;TBP interactions in vitro and reconstitute transcription in crude systems (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">McCulloch et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Schramm and Hernandez 2002</xref>). While the in vivo role of different BRF1 isoforms remains to be elucidated, our zebrafish data provide further evidence of the pathogenic nature of the four missense variants.</p><p>Further studies showed each of the missense variants to affect a variety of relevant activities in yeast, including target gene promoter occupancy, in vitro transcription, and cell growth. We do not know the precise mechanism by which <italic>BRF1</italic> contributes to the phenotype in humans. We note, however, that mouse <italic>Brf1</italic> is expressed in anatomical structures that are relevant to the observed human pathology: In situ hybridization of postnatal day 56 mouse brain had previously revealed prominent <italic>Brf1</italic> expression in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and the Purkinje and granule cell layers of the cerebellum (Allen Brain Atlas) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Sunkin et al. 2013</xref>), underscoring the important role of BRF1 in brain development.</p><p>We speculate that one plausible pathomechanism underlying the cerebellar-facial-dental syndrome is a reduced steady-state level of tRNAs that would be predicted to impair translation elongation; this may explain the growth defect in yeast and contribute to short stature in the affected individuals. Whether the major drivers of the phenotype are tRNAs or other Pol III&#x2013;dependent transcripts remains to be determined. Finally, it is also unknown why partial disruption of Pol III transcription leads to organ- and tissue-specific phenotypes. There are &#x223C;450 nuclear encoded tRNA genes in the human genome for only 61 anticodons. It has been shown previously that up to 26% of tRNA genes are active in one cell type versus another (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barski et al. 2010</xref>) and that tRNA expression varies by as much as tenfold among human tissues (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dittmar et al. 2006</xref>), suggesting the existence of active cell and tissue-specific regulation of Pol III transcription (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Oler et al. 2010</xref>). Although the genome-wide architecture of Pol III&#x2013;mediated transcription in neurons or specific brain regions is unknown, a pilot study using a microarray containing 42 probes for nuclear encoded tRNAs and assaying their relative expression among eight human tissues revealed a high overall tRNA expression level in brain (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dittmar et al. 2006</xref>). This observation may partially explain the vulnerability of brain regions toward impaired tRNA transcription or processing. Whether other affected tissues, such as the teeth, also show specific tRNA expression patterns remains to be investigated. We note that dental anomalies such as delayed dentition, hypodontia, oligodontia, and abnormally placed or shaped teeth are part of the Pol III&#x2013;related leukodystrophy syndromes 4H; ataxia, delayed dentition, and hypomyelination (ADDH); and leukodystrophy with oligodontia (LO) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Daoud et al. 2013</xref>). An alternative explanation for the tissue-restricted phenotypes engendered by BRF1 dysfunction might be a partial functional redundancy with BRF2. It has been shown, however, that BRF1 and BRF2 are almost completely mutually exclusive as components of TFIIIB under physiological conditions (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Moqtaderi et al. 2010</xref>), and whether BRF2 can partially compensate for defective BRF1 is unknown.</p><p>In conclusion, our study defines a syndrome with cerebellar hypoplasia, intellectual disability, and growth retardation that is caused by partial deficiency of the conserved Pol III transcription factor BRF1. These results add an example to the short list of genetic diseases caused by dysregulation of the Pol III machinery, most of which predominantly affect the central nervous system and suggest that improved understanding of the potential target specificity provided by BRF1 might offer pathomechanistic clues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was performed with the approval of the University of Ulm Ethics Committee.
