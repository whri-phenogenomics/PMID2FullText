      </caption>
      <p>Posttranscriptional modifications of RNA (i.e. the epitranscriptome) play an important role in several physiological functions and diseases. Neuronal regulation is also thought to be finely regulated by RNA modification proteins, as dysfunction of these proteins is known to contribute to several neurological disorders. However, the regulatory mechanism involving transfer RNA (tRNA)-modifying proteins remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that the tRNA-modifying protein AlkB homolog 8 (ALKBH8) plays an essential role in neurological functioning through oxidative stress regulation. Recently, mutations in <italic toggle="yes">ALKBH8</italic> have been detected in individuals with intellectual disability. Our findings provide novel insights into the function of tRNA-modifying enzymes in the context of the physiology of the central nervous system and the development of neurological diseases.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Posttranscriptional modification of messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA is collectively known as the epitranscriptome. The relevant chemical moieties are added or removed by proteins called &#x201C;writers&#x201D; or &#x201C;erasers,&#x201D; respectively, whereas the modified RNAs are recognized by &#x201C;readers&#x201D; (<xref rid="pgae115-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Among the epitranscriptome-associated molecules, members of the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) family possess a domain similar to the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase domain (2-OG domain) of <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> AlkB and are thought to function as erasers. The human ALKBH family consists of nine proteins (ALKBH1&#x2013;8 and fat mass and obesity associated [FTO]) that catalyze the demethylation of various RNA (<xref rid="pgae115-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x2013;6</xref>) as well as DNA (<xref rid="pgae115-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and proteins (<xref rid="pgae115-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
      <p>A growing body of evidence indicates that the epitranscriptome plays an important role in development (<xref rid="pgae115-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), obesity (<xref rid="pgae115-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and certain types of cancer (<xref rid="pgae115-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, there have been very few studies on the functions of the ALKBH family in the central nervous system and any possible associations with neurological disorders. ALKBH1 is reported to contribute to axon regeneration (<xref rid="pgae115-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and hippocampus-dependent learning (<xref rid="pgae115-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Alkbh5 deficiency in mice results in profound and deleterious effects on cerebellar development under hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="pgae115-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Moreover, FTO-deficient mice show impaired learning and memory due to decreased adult neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, as well as reduced brain size and body weight (<xref rid="pgae115-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
      <p>The functions of ALKBH proteins are mediated by demethylating the N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine of genes in brain cells. However, ALKBH8 has a unique molecular structure in that it contains not only the 2-OG domain commonly found in the ALKBH family, but also a methyltransferase (MT) domain that is not present in other ALKBH family proteins (<xref rid="pgae115-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The wobble uridine of tRNA (U34) is known to be the substrate of ALKBH8. This uridine at the first position of the anticodon region can have multiple modifications and form wobble base pairs with the corresponding mRNA codon in the ribosome to ensure precise decoding of the genetic code (<xref rid="pgae115-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). ALKBH8 methylates 5-carboxymethyluridine (cm5U) as a substrate via the MT domain and then hydroxylates it via the 2-OG domain to generate 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) and (S)-5-methoxycarbonylhydroxymethyluridine ((S)-mchm5U) (<xref rid="pgae115-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These modifications at U34 are found in selenocysteine tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>, which is essential for the biosynthesis of selenoproteins (<xref rid="pgae115-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), including glutathione peroxidases (Gpx1, Gpx3, and Gpx6) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (<xref rid="pgae115-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). At the cellular level, <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic> depletion caused a reduction in the mcm5U level and the accumulation of cm5U to diminish cellular survival upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents (<xref rid="pgae115-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Studies using <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>def</sup> MEFs) have shown that the induction of cellular senescence is accompanied by increased mitochondrial mass and oxygen consumption (<xref rid="pgae115-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>def</sup> MEFs were sensitive to reactive oxygen species damage caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or rotenone (<xref rid="pgae115-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Regardless of these in vitro findings, it has been reported that <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic>-deficient mice are viable under normal conditions (<xref rid="pgae115-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) but are significantly affected when exposed to external environmental stresses that induce lung dysfunction (<xref rid="pgae115-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, the physiological functions of ALKBH8 in vivo remain to be elucidated.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigated the biological functions of ALKBH8 using <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic>-knockout (<italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) mice. We observed that <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice exhibited altered behavior, indicating central nervous system dysfunction. We also observed abnormal brain pathology in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, which may have been caused by oxidative stress. Furthermore, oxidative stress-related proteins were found to be differentially regulated in the brain of these mice. The contribution of ALKBH8 to oxidative stress regulation was also supported by metabolic changes in the methionine and glutathione pathways. Finally, we observed a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in primary neurons and glial cells derived from <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic>
<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were generated by deleting exons 3 and 4, which contain the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The deletion created a frameshift to introduce a termination codon before the exons encoding the RRM domain (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). As a result, amino acid sequences from 89 to 709 have been removed, leaving only the segment coding for amino acids 1 to 88. Heterozygous and homozygous deletion of the gene was confirmed using PCR targeting the deleted exons 3 and 4 region (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). The body weights of both male and female <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were lower than those of wild-type (<italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) mice (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). The expression of ALKBH8 in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was assessed using western blotting (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). To further confirm the deficient enzymatic activity in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, nucleoside modifications in the low-molecular-weight RNA fraction, which contains tRNA, were quantified using mass spectrometry (MS). A significant accumulation of cm5U and a decrease in its methylated form, mcm5U, were observed in organ-derived RNA of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice compared with that of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. Furthermore, (S)-mchm5U levels were below the detection limit in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice RNA (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). qPCR analysis confirmed that <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic> mRNA was expressed in all examined organs, including the brain, spleen, and liver (Fig. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>). Interestingly, higher mcm5U levels were detected in the brain than in the spleen and liver of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. These results suggest that the cm5U to mcm5U conversion RNA modification is important for brain function and that a partial compensatory pathway may have operated to maintain a functional level (Fig. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>). Figure <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref> illustrates the uridine modification pathway based on information from the Modomics database (<xref rid="pgae115-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In addition to (S)-mchm5U, decreased 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2&#x2032;-O-methyluridine (mcm5Um) and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine levels were observed in the brain of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, but no decrease in the level of 5-carboxyhydroxymethyluridine (chm5U), which is synthesized downstream of cm5U, was observed. With regard to uridine modifications involving carbamoyl groups, the levels of 5-carbamoylmethyluridine and 5-carbamoylmethyl-2&#x2032;-O-methyluridine were unchanged, while that of 5-carbamoylhydroxymethyluridine (nchm5U), which was not detectable in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, was markedly increased in RNA from the brain of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. Although the regulatory mechanism of the uridine carbamoyl modification pathway remains unclear, the increase in nchm5U level may indicate a relative up-regulation of this pathway owing to the suppression of modifications after cm5U due to the loss of ALKBH8.</p>

        <title>Altered behavior of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice</title>
        <p>We noticed certain behavioral abnormalities in the established <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice during handling, including more agile movements than in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. To investigate further, we conducted behavioral tests using adult male experimental mice. The novel object recognition (NOR) test is used to measure short-term recognition memory (<xref rid="pgae115-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). After a training session, mice were allowed to freely explore a familiar object used in the training session as well as a novel object. Alkbh8<sup>+/+</sup> mice spent more time exploring the novel object because of the innate preference of mice for novelty. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice showed little difference in exploratory time between the familiar and novel objects (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), as the discrimination index (DI), which is used to represent recognition memory sensitivity (<xref rid="pgae115-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), tended to be lower in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, although the difference was not statistically significant. The rotarod test (RRT) is used to assess motor coordination and balance in rodents, which can be affected by drug exposure or neurological disorders (<xref rid="pgae115-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). After the training session, the latency to fall with increasing speed was evaluated. The latency to fall of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was significantly prolonged compared with that of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). We also conducted the forced swim test (FST), in which immobility time is often used to examine the efficacy of antidepressants; the latency to the first immobility period is also used as a parameter to differentiate between antidepressants and psychostimulants (<xref rid="pgae115-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).

        <p>Due to the differences in nucleoside modifications in the brain and altered behavior that may have been due to neurological dysfunction, we performed a histopathological examination of the brains of male <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. First, we confirmed that ALKBH8 was expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, and that its expression was reduced in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice (Figs. <xref rid="pgae115-F1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref>). The whole-brain weight of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was significantly lower than that of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Because the body weight of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice is lower than <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice, we explored the correlation between body weight and organ mass. While the other tissues showed a correlation with body weight and tissue weight, the brain exhibits a consistent decrease in brain weight independent of body weight (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). Next, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sagittal and coronal brain sections were evaluated. The cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus is known to be sensitive to ischemic and hypoxic stress, with shrunken and darkly stained pyknotic neurons being indicative of ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration (<xref rid="pgae115-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

        <title>Changes in oxidative stress-related protein and metabolite levels in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice</title>
        <p>ALKBH8 regulates protein translation through tRNA modification. To comprehensively examine protein expression, a proteome analysis of samples from the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of adult male mice was conducted. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant differences in protein expression profiles among brain tissues, which were separated by component 1 (i.e. the cerebellum from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus) and component 2 (separation of all three tissues). The difference between <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was relatively small but distinguished by component 3 (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a method of enrichment analysis often used to identify differentially expressed gene sets, as it allows the analysis of all genes, including those with smaller changes in expression. As the differences between <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were small, we used GSEA in addition to fold-change analysis to identify the relevant differentially expressed proteins in this study. First, we found significant enrichment in oxidative stress- and mitochondria-related ontologies in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="pgae115-F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). This included the up-regulation of many mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and proteins of the mitochondrial complex I, although the changes were small (Fig. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref>). Second, ontologies related to the immune response were commonly enriched among the three tissues. Additionally, among the proteins up- or down-regulated by more than 2-fold, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) and &#x3B3;-glutamyltransferase 7 (GGT7), which are potential oxidative stress regulators, were significantly down-regulated (Figs. <xref rid="pgae115-F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>). We also observed pathological changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus but not in the cerebellum (Figs. <xref rid="pgae115-F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). This suggests that oxidative stress-related proteins enriched in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus contribute to the observed pathological changes.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>ALKBH8 is a &#x201C;writer&#x201D; enzyme that modifies the wobble uridine of tRNA and regulates protein translation, including that of selenoproteins. It has been reported that ALKBH8 has protective effects against several external stimuli, such as hydrogen peroxide, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, DNA-damaging agents, a glycolytic inhibitor, and environmental pollutants (<xref rid="pgae115-B24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x2013;26</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), but specific details regarding its in vivo biological functions are limited. To investigate the in vivo biological functions of ALKBH8, we established <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice and observed that the organs of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice had a marked accumulation of cm5U, whereas (s)-mchm5U level was below the detection limit. cm5U is used as a substrate by ALKBH8 and converted to mcm5U and mcm5Um by its MT activity. In <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, the reduction in mcm5U and mcm5Um levels was significantly lower in brain tissues than in the liver and spleen. It has been reported that mcm5U is required for the translation of housekeeping selenoproteins, whereas mcm5Um is required for stress response-related selenoproteins (<xref rid="pgae115-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The methylation of cm5U to mcm5U and mcm5Um in the brains of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice may have been somewhat compensated for by some kind of mechanism to maintain the minimum essential RNA modification required for survival. Our proteomics analysis did detect several selenoproteins, but no significant differences were noted between <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice in this regard. This finding is consistent with the previous report in which selenoproteins&#x2019; expression in liver, heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and brain in their <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice was examined, and only the reduction of GPX1 in liver was observed (<xref rid="pgae115-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These findings indicate tissue-specific regulation of selenoprotein expression by mcm5U or mcm5Um. Although no enzyme other than ALKBH8 is known to catalyze the methylation of cm5U to mcm5U and mcm5Um, we detected a slight but statistically significant elevation in the levels of elongator acetyltransferase complex subunits (ELP1, 2, and 3) in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C</xref>). ELP1, 2, and 3 assemble into a complex, bind RNA, and modify uridine into cm5U (<xref rid="pgae115-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). These results suggest that there are some feedback mechanisms that might function to detect and compensate for the reduction of mcm5U, mcm5Um, and their downstream metabolites.</p>
      <p>Abnormal behaviors, such as more agile movements of <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, were observed by chance during daily rearing and led us to conduct behavioral tests. We observed a reduction in exploring time of a novel object in the NOR, increased latency to fall in the RRT, and increased latency to the first immobility period in the FST in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice compared with those in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. The NOR, RRT, and FST results are interpreted as indices of short-term recognition memory, motor coordination, and response to antidepressants, respectively. Although further detailed examination of behavioral abnormalities is required, we believe that these test results are indicative of central nervous system dysfunction in <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. Associations between several RNA-modifying enzymes and neurological diseases have been reported. Loss-of-function mutations in NOP2/Sun RNA MT2 and MT6 (NSUN2 and NSUN6, respectively) have been identified as the cause of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID) in humans (<xref rid="pgae115-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Moreover, ELP2 mutations have been detected in patients with ID and autism spectrum disorder (<xref rid="pgae115-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Behavioral abnormalities indicating loss of learning ability have been observed In <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="pgae115-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, the tests used to detect these abnormalities differed from those used for <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice in this study (i.e. contextual and cued fear-conditioning test and Morris water maze test for <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh1</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice and the NOR, RRT, and FST for <italic toggle="yes">Albkh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice). These differences suggest that the ALKBH family and/or other components of the epitranscriptomic machinery not only work cooperatively in the central nervous system but also have specific individual functions.</p>
      <p>To determine the cause of the observed behavioral abnormalities in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, brain pathology was evaluated. <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice showed a consistent decrease in brain weight independent of body weight compared with <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. It is not clear whether the decrease in brain weight was due to pathological changes. Nonetheless, some qualitative changes were also observed in the brain. The hippocampus, especially the CA1 region, is known to be vulnerable to ischemic injury (<xref rid="pgae115-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), which causes neuronal cell death that manifests as shrunken and darkly stained pyknotic neurons. In <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, weak eosin staining was observed in the fiber tracts adjacent to the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and increased numbers of pyknotic neurons were observed in layer III and the inner layers of the temporal lobe but not in the CA1 region. These observations suggest that neurons in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice had undergone hypoxic damage, which can lead to abnormal behavior. Although this observation was relatively weak compared with the pathological changes observed in ischemia models (<xref rid="pgae115-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), it may be consistent with the less severe abnormal behavior observed. A tendency toward enlargement of the lateral ventricles was also observed; this is a known phenotype observed in hydrocephalus and indicates a disturbance in CSF homeostasis (<xref rid="pgae115-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The enlarged VR spaces observed in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were also thought to be a result of impaired CSF flow. These pathological phenotypes may have also resulted in the observed neuronal damage and abnormal behavior.</p>
      <p>The findings regarding histopathological changes in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice associated with hypoxic damage were also supported by the analyses of changes in protein expression and metabolism. Notably, the levels of NNT and GGT7 were found to be significantly reduced. NNT is a mitochondrial protein that is involved in peroxide detoxification through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism (<xref rid="pgae115-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and also has important functions in brain mitochondria (<xref rid="pgae115-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). GGT7 is of the &#x3B3;-glutamyltransferase family; these proteins are involved in glutathione metabolism, but the function of GGT7 has not been well studied although its potential activity has been predicted based on its amino acid homology with GGT1 (<xref rid="pgae115-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It has been reported that GGT7 expression is higher in the brain than in other tissues (<xref rid="pgae115-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) and that it has protective effects against glioblastoma growth (<xref rid="pgae115-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). On the other hand, GSEA identified the up-regulation of oxidative stress and mitochondria-related ontologies in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, including in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and many proteins of mitochondrial complex I. Based on our observations of reduced levels of amino acids related to glutathione synthesis and a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential in neurons and glial cells in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, the up-regulation of mitochondrial proteins in the GSEA seems to be unrelated to the up-regulation of its function. Rather, it appears that it represents a feedback signal to compensate for the reduced protective function against oxidative stress. Translational regulation via tRNA modification by ALKBH8 has not yet been fully elucidated. Several tRNAs are known to be modified by ALKBH8 (i.e. tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(UCU), tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(UUG), tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>(UUC), tRNA<sup>Sec</sup>(UCA), tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>(UCC), and tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>(UUU)) (<xref rid="pgae115-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). These tRNAs are widely used for multiple protein translation and it is difficult to elucidate contribution to specific protein. Further technical advance is required to reveal direct link between these modifications and the proteins we found in this study. This study has not yet elucidated the specific oxidative stress that impacts mouse behavior. Oxidative stress can influence brain function broadly from developmental stages to adulthood (<xref rid="pgae115-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Future research aimed at identifying the types and timing of oxidative stressors affecting behavior is expected to provide a more detailed understanding of their contribution.</p>
      <p>In this study, we identified certain the characteristic phenotypes of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, including reduced body weight and brain weight, pathological changes in the brain, and molecular changes related to oxidative stress. However, these findings are somewhat inconsistent with those of previous reports. Songe-M&#xF8;ller et al. (<xref rid="pgae115-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) reported dysfunction of tRNA wobble uridine modification in <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice, but no obvious phenotype was reported. Leonardi et al. reported that <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice are viable and produce offspring that survive to adulthood under normal care conditions; however, they also observed an increase in oxidative stress markers under basal conditions and a higher susceptibility to lung damage when the mice were exposed to naphthalene, an environmental toxin (<xref rid="pgae115-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pgae115-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In our behavioral examinations of <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup></italic> mice, no severe behavioral disorder or pronounced phenotypic change was observed. Had we not been careful in our observations, we may have not have noticed the differences between the wild-type and mutant mice. Nevertheless, Leonardi et al. observed significant phenotypic changes under stress induction, and Songe-M&#xF8;ller et al. mentioned their interest in analyses aimed at detecting minor changes in the appearance and functioning of the neural system. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of the use of a different targeting strategy against the <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic> gene (i.e. our <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice lack the 2-OG, MT, and RRM domain, on the other hand, Songe-M&#xF8;ller et al. and Leonardi et al. used the deletion of 2-OG and MT domain but not RRM), there is no evidence that the RRM region alone has any function related to tRNA modification. The development of knockin mice with mutated <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic> found in human will provide new insights, particularly in terms of extrapolation to humans.</p>
      <p>Our findings indicate that ALKBH8 plays an important role in the maintenance of central nervous function by regulating oxidative stress. Recently, multiple <italic toggle="yes">ALKBH8</italic> mutations have been identified in the causative gene of patients with ID (<xref rid="pgae115-B51" ref-type="bibr">51&#x2013;54</xref>), and the mutations were located within or near the MT domain. We generated two recombinant proteins with the <italic toggle="yes">ALKBH8</italic> mutations and confirmed that these proteins lost their MT activity, but not their 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase activity. Although the detailed mechanisms by which ALKBH8 affects ID is unknown, it becomes clear from our experiments with the recombinant ALKBH8 proteins that the reported accumulation of cm5U and decrease in mcm5U, mchm5U, and mcm5Um levels in the lymphoblasts of patients are due to changes in enzyme activity caused by mutations in the MT domain of ALKBH8. However, in our <italic toggle="yes">Alkbh8</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mouse brains, we observed either unchanged or up-regulated RNA modification pathway activity, including that related to the carbamoyl group. Along with some degree of compensation of mcm5U, (S)-mchm5U, and the downstream modification pathway may be more important for the observed brain phenotype. Recently, we found that ALKBH4 contributes to the hydroxylation of mcm5U to (R)-mchm5U and its further conversion, and that the modification affects the efficacy of protein translation (<xref rid="pgae115-B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). How these modified tRNA regulate protein translation in the brain is unknown, but a comprehensive understanding of how tRNA modification and protein translation are directly affected by ALKBH8 and regulated by other related enzymes, such as ALKBH4, is required to further understand the molecular mechanisms of action of ALKBH8. Additional neurological analyses and behavioral tests are also important to link the findings of animal models to human disorders.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that ALKBH8 plays an essential role in neurological functions through an oxidative stress-regulation mechanism. Our findings also highlight the importance of several proteins and metabolites affected by ALKBH8 and (S)-mchm5U and their downstream tRNA modifications. Further elucidation of the functional mechanism of ALKBH8 is expected to contribute to the understanding of the physiological functions of the central nervous system and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, such as ID.</p>
