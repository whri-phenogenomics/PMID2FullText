        <p>Spencer et al. report the first description of human IL-6R deficiency in two patients presenting with recurrent infections, atopy, elevated IgE, and abnormal acute-phase responses.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>IL-6 excess is central to the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory conditions and is targeted in clinical practice by immunotherapy that blocks the IL-6 receptor encoded by <italic>IL6R</italic>. We describe two patients with homozygous mutations in <italic>IL6R</italic> who presented with recurrent infections, abnormal acute-phase responses, elevated IgE, eczema, and eosinophilia. This study identifies a novel primary immunodeficiency, clarifying the contribution of IL-6 to the phenotype of patients with mutations in <italic>IL6ST, STAT3</italic>, and <italic>ZNF341,</italic> genes encoding different components of the IL-6 signaling pathway, and alerts us to the potential toxicity of drugs targeting the IL-6R.</p>

  <body><p>The central role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and giant cell arteritis is confirmed by the efficacy of tocilizumab, an anti&#x2013;IL-6R antibody (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). IL-6 interacts with a multi-subunit receptor complex, initially by the binding of IL-6 to the 80-kD receptor (IL-6R), which exists in either membrane-bound or soluble forms. The IL-6/IL-6R complex ligates the signal-transducing subunit, glycoprotein 130 (GP130), leading to a wave of receptor, JAK, and STAT phosphorylation and culminating in the nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT) dimers, predominantly STAT3, that activate transcription, leading to growth and cellular differentiation (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Taga and Kishimoto, 1997</xref>).</p><p>While the consequences of excessive IL-6 signaling in humans have been well established, the consequences of impairment have been more elusive. Reports of disease-causing neutralizing IL-6 antibodies have been informative (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Puel et al., 2008</xref>); however, those reports would benefit from the corroboration and specificity that the study of genetic loss provides. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations affecting GP130 and STAT3 lead to multisystem disorders encompassing IgE elevation, infection susceptibility, and connective tissue abnormalities (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Grimbacher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Schwerd et al., 2017</xref>); however, the specific contribution of IL-6 remains undefined. Studies of patients with loss of IL-6R function therefore provide a unique opportunity to establish the role for IL-6 in these disorders and define how impaired IL-6 signaling impacts human health.</p><sec sec-type="results|discussion" id="s01"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s02"><title>Clinical findings</title><p>We identified two patients with atopic dermatitis, elevated IgE, reduced inflammatory responses, and recurrent skin and lung infections. Patient 1 (P1; 29-yr-old female), who was born to white English parents of European ancestry without known consanguinity, initially presented with neonatal mastitis. She suffered from recurrent sinopulmonary infections including <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> pneumonia and recurrent deep staphylococcal skin infections. She also suffered from asthma and moderate atopic dermatitis, affecting lower legs, thighs, buttocks, and elbows. The dermatitis was associated with extensive subcutaneous nodules that were intensely pruritic, and persistent scratching led to development of deep excoriations on legs, buttocks, arms, shoulders, and scalp. Apart from one episode of impetiginized varicella infection in her first year, no significant viral infections were noted. Total IgE level was elevated, with the highest recorded level being 7,060 kU/liter (normal 0&#x2013;81 kU/liter). She had mildly reduced IgG, IgA, and IgM. A striking feature was a lack of clinically adequate inflammatory response in the face of marked infection. While she did develop minor nontender lymphadenopathy in a number of infections, her abscesses were notable for their lack of erythema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and pyrexia. A recordable fever was observed on only two occasions, throughout multiple inpatient admissions for systemic infection. In addition, the peripheral neutrophil response was typically minimal in proportion to her illnesses, and infectious episodes were more marked by eosinophilia than neutrophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Further, despite gross elevations in serum IL-6 levels (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which stimulates the serological acute phase response (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Majello et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson et al., 1994</xref>), C-reactive protein (CRP) was never detectable during infection or convalescence on standard diagnostic assay (detection level 0.175 mg/liter). Patient 2 (P2; 15-yr-old male) was born to consanguineous parents of Pakistani origin. From 6 mo of age, he suffered from relapsing-remitting, itchy, eczematous skin lesions (with no other history of clinical allergy, severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: 61.85) which were managed with topical fusidic acid and betamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). The family history was remarkable for the early deaths of a sibling and a cousin, who were both affected by similar skin lesions, but no further details are known. In his first 2 yr of life, P2 had recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and two pneumonias, requiring hospitalization and i.v. antibiotic treatment. At age 10, he developed a methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> psoas abscess requiring surgical drainage. He also had recurrent skin abscesses; however, his CRP was barely above the limits of detection (highest recording 2.1 mg/liter), even during acute inflammatory episodes. Serum biochemical parameters and liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits. No viral or fungal infections were noted. Neutrophilia was observed in blood counts during abscess episodes, and IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were mildly reduced; in contrast, IgE was elevated (787 kU/liter, normal range 0&#x2013;100 kU/liter). At present, he receives regular i.v. immunoglobulin replacement and antibiotic prophylaxis, alleviating his symptoms.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Skin lesions, pedigrees, genetic sequencing results, and IL-6R expression levels in two patients with immunodeficiency, atopy, and abnormal inflammatory responses.

Since read depth was even across all chromosomes (excluding large genomic deletions), the C1 loss of heterozygosity is explained by uniparental isodisomy, when both homologous chromosomes are inherited from the same parent. C1 contained a set of rare coding homozygous variants (Table S2) with one priority candidate: a 1-bp frameshift deletion (NM_000565.3:c.548delG; p.G183Efs*7) in exon 4 of the <italic>IL6R</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) that leads to a premature stop codon. For P2, whole-exome sequencing identified two homozygous missense variants in exon 6 of <italic>IL6R</italic> (ENST00000368485.3:c.836T&gt;A, p.I279N, combined annotation-dependent depletion [CADD] score 24.8, and ENST00000368485.3:c.839A&gt;C, p.H280P, CADD score 10.5). Both variants were ultrarare, had high CADD scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), relative to previously observed homozygous <italic>IL6R</italic> variants, and are predicted to be damaging because their CADD scores are above the mutation significance cutoff (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Itan et al., 2016</xref>) of 3.313 (the lower 99% CI of CADD-based mutation significance cutoff for <italic>IL6R</italic> variants, estimated using pathogenic mutations reported in Human Gene Mutation Database and ClinVar). The H280 amino acid is at (and the I279 adjacent to) the face of IL-6R&#x2019;s D2 convex bulge that docks into the D3 domain of GP130. Since this interface is necessary for the IL-6/IL-6R complex&#x2019;s GP130 affinity (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Boulanger et al., 2003</xref>), disruption due to amino acid substitution at these sites could limit IL-6 signaling. Both variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and appropriately segregated under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). The candidate variants in P1 and P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>) are novel and not found in the aggregate 150,000 human genomes available from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine, and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) BioResource&#x2013;Rare Diseases (NBR-RD).</p><p>We next tested the effect of the mutations on the expression and function of IL-6R. The homozygous premature stop of P1 led to reduced surface IL-6R expression on CD45RO<sup>+</sup> memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD27<sup>&#x2212;</sup> memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, in comparison to healthy control expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). By contrast, surface IL-6R expression was present on peripheral blood lymphocytes of P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 J</xref>). Despite P2&#x2019;s normal receptor expression, IL-6&#x2013;mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT1 proteins was absent in P1 and barely detectable in P2, contrasting with a normal response to IL-27 and IL-21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B&#x2013;D</xref>). GP130 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes of P1 was actually increased compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), likely due to the absence of IL-6&#x2013;mediated down-regulation (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). This result therefore additionally demonstrates that a level of tonic IL-6 signaling occurs in healthy controls. Given that IL-6 and IL-27 both signal through GP130 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Pflanz et al., 2004</xref>), the STAT-signaling data confirmed normal GP130 signal transduction and localized the lesion to IL-6R in both patients.</p><fig id="fig2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>STAT signaling responses with and without ectopic expression of IL-6R in two patients with <italic>IL6R</italic> mutations.

To investigate the pathogenicity of the two homozygous variants identified in P2, because of the limited primary tissue available, HEK293 cells were used. As two homozygous variants had been identified, to identify which was the causative mutation, cells were transfected with WT, p.I279N, p.H280P, or p.I279N/p.H280P vectors (the latter including both variants in the same plasmid). IL-6&#x2013;induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was deficient in p.I279N-transfected cells, whereas the responses were normal in WT and p.H280P transfectants, demonstrating that the p.I279N variant, rather than p.H280P variant, was pathogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Of note, while an I279D substitution completely abrogated IL-6 binding to IL-6R (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yawata et al., 1993</xref>), staining for IL-6R in transfected cells showed that although Flag-tagged protein levels were equivalent in I279N and WT, IL-6R staining was substantially reduced (Fig. S1). The discrepancy in surface staining between the ex vivo and transfected cells could be explained by the presence of soluble IL-6R bound to patient PBMCs, which could contribute to the normalized staining ex vivo, whereas the transfection experiments express only membrane-bound IL-6R. There could also be other posttranscriptional processing differences in the overexpression system which may be altered uniquely by the I279N mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Immunophenotyping</title><p>The above results defining P1 as IL-6R null and P2 with protein-positive IL-6R-LOF provided a unique opportunity to investigate the contribution of IL-6 to the immunological phenotype.

P1 had reduced numbers of class-switched memory B cells, and within this population a higher proportion of IgE- and IgG4-expressing B cells was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). P1 also had an increased proportion of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, with increased relative expression of <italic>FOXP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), and this was confirmed on flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

The impairment was present even in the condition of IL-23 addition without IL-6, potentially because IL-23R must be up-regulated by a STAT3 agonist (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et al., 2011</xref>). The impairment was not due to a global transcriptional unresponsiveness to these cytokines since, in addition to the <italic>RORC</italic> up-regulation, the fold increase with stimulation was comparable to controls, despite the lower absolute basal and induced levels of STAT3-target, <italic>SOCS3</italic>, induced by IL-21, IL-23, and IL-27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). These results demonstrate a nonredundant role for IL-6 in the in vitro induction of the expression of <italic>IL17A</italic>, but not <italic>RORC</italic> from naive precursors. It is likely that in vivo, given the presence of Th17 cells and absence of fungal infections dependent on IL-17, there are redundant cytokines that allow for Th17 differentiation in the absence of IL-6 signaling.</p><fig id="fig3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Immunophenotype of IL-6R&#x2013;null patient.

While both patients and controls had comparable production of IL-17A, they both had reduced production of IFN&#x3B3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The elevated GATA3 seen in the single-cell, PBMC, and naive T-cell induction experiments from P1 was not associated with increased CCR4<sup>+</sup> (correlated to Th2 cells) levels, or any striking increase in the production of Th2 cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 ex vivo (Fig. S3). However, pathological effector Th2 cells, which are more closely associated with Th2-associated tissue pathology (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Mitson-Salazar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Wambre et al., 2017</xref>), were elevated in both patients, although more markedly in P1, consistent with the higher IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). While an expansion of such proatopic T cells is consistent with the clinical phenotype, this result appears initially surprising because of data implicating IL-6 in generating Th2 cells (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Rinc&#xF3;n et al., 1997</xref>) and promoting IgE class switching (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Vercelli et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Jabara et al., 1990</xref>). However, STAT3 activation leads to the expression of and physical binding to ERBIN, encoded by the gene <italic>ERBB2IP</italic>, which limits TGF-&#x3B2; signaling by cytoplasmic sequestering of the SMAD2/3 components and normally prevents expression of IL-4R&#x3B1; on naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells, restraining Th2 responses (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Lyons et al., 2017</xref>). Corroborating this was the observation that P1&#x2019;s <italic>IL4R</italic> expression was elevated in these cell types in the single-cell RNA-seq analysis (Fig. S3). So, IL-6 may have opposing roles in Th2 responses, in that it can promote IL-4 transcription (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Diehl et al., 2002</xref>) and IgE class switching but could prevent IL-4 receptor expression by blocking TGF-&#x3B2; signaling.</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Immunophenotype of patients with <italic>IL6R</italic> mutations.

Both patients had a reduced percentage of cTFH cells compared with healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6 (initially termed as the B cell differentiation factor) promotes B cell differentiation, and both patients had reduced CD27<sup>positive</sup> memory B cells and reduced class-switched memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p><p>Aspects of these patients&#x2019; clinical phenotype are shared by patients with mutations in <italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>IL6ST</italic> (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Schwerd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Shahin et al., 2019</xref>), or <italic>ZNF341</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">B&#xE9;ziat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Frey-Jakobs et al., 2018</xref>), which are part of a series of disorders associated with IgE elevation (Table S1). ZNF341 deficiency leads to impaired STAT3 levels and signaling, primarily in the hematopoietic compartment, and is associated with atopy, variable elevation of IgE, and susceptibility to <italic>Candida</italic> and staphylococcal infections. The similarities to the <italic>IL6ST-mutant</italic> patient are greater, as the GP130-deficient patients presented with recurrent staphylococcal and streptococcal infections and a marked reduction of an acute-phase response, but with eosinophilia and elevation of their IgE. In addition, similar to IL-6R deficiency described here, fungal infections were not a feature, in keeping with diminished but present circulating Th17 cells seen in these patients. However, like <italic>STAT3</italic> LOF patients, the affected <italic>IL6ST</italic> patients also demonstrated skeletal and connective tissue defects, such as craniosynostosis and scoliosis, possibly caused by GP130-dependent cytokines such as IL-11 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Schwerd et al., 2017</xref>). The IL-6 link with the atopic phenotype of this group of patients had been suggested by the association between common polymorphisms in the <italic>IL6R</italic> that diminish its function and increase both levels of IgE (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and susceptibility to asthma (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, B cell&#x2013;specific deletion of STAT3 is sufficient to elevate serum IgE in mice (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2016</xref>). The results from the IL-6R-LOF patients therefore clarify the contribution of deficient IL-6 signaling to the phenotype of patients with <italic>ZNF341</italic>, <italic>GP130</italic>, and <italic>STAT3</italic>-LOF mutations. This includes elevated IgE, atopic dermatitis, and a susceptibility to staphylococcal infections. This may indicate novel therapeutics for the alleviation of these symptoms: for example, exogenous recombinant soluble IL-6R could increase the presentation of IL-6 to GP130.</p><p>Although results from murine studies have suggested that IL-6 signaling is an obligate necessity for a normal acute-phase response, we have lacked confirmatory evidence for this in humans. STAT3-LOF patients and GP130 patients have reduced but detectable acute-phase proteins, including CRP (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Holland, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Schwerd et al., 2017</xref>), while patients with anti&#x2013;IL-6 autoantibodies, who present with skin infections similar to the patients presented here, may also have other neutralizing autoantibodies preventing CRP induction (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Puel et al., 2008</xref>). This report demonstrates that human CRP production is directly dependent on IL-6 signaling and therefore that a recordable CRP in a tocilizumab-treated patient indicates incomplete IL-6 blockade. In addition to basic insights into inborn errors of the IL-6/GP130/STAT3 axis, the patients described in this report provide clear evidence for the scope of potential side effects of IL-6 blockade. Furthermore, they highlight the consequences of inborn loss of IL-6 signaling, corroborating the intriguing observation that very early introduction of tocilizumab (&lt;2 yr of age), unlike in adults, is associated with substantially increased immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Mallalieu et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s05"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s06"><title>Detailed case history</title><p>P1 was born postterm after a normal pregnancy, to nonconsanguineous white English parents of European ancestry. Her birthweight was 2.8 kg (9th&#x2013;25th centile). She was admitted for 2 wk with apyrexial neonatal mastitis within the first month, and within the first year of life she had suffered from multiple infections, including impetiginized varicella and right and left lower lobe pneumonias, and was noted to have painless lymphadenopathy. She received standard childhood vaccinations, including diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, polio, and measles/mumps/rubella, without complications. She continued to grow normally on height and weight centile charts, always above the 50th centile.</p><p>Having been managed initially by her local district general hospital, she was referred to a specialist immunology service at the age of 5 yr with <italic>H. influenza</italic> pneumonia associated with right lower lobe collapse, and a right ear infection, which responded to antibiotics. Nontender cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted; biopsy of 6&#x2013;10-mm inguinal lymph nodes demonstrated reactive changes but was notable for an excess of eosinophils, and cultures grew <italic>S. aureus</italic>. She responded to treatment with i.v. flucloxacillin, and after this she was commenced antibiotic prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole 480 mg once a day; however, purulent rhinitis and upper respiratory tract symptoms persisted despite prophylaxis. She received <italic>H. influenza B</italic> and pneumococcal vaccination (Pneumovax) at age 6 without complication. Antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus, and diphtheria were found to be present. On the basis of her elevated IgE levels, a putative diagnosis of hyper-IgE syndrome was given, with an National Institutes of Health hyper-IgE syndrome score retrospectively calculated at 45. However, IgE levels subsequently fluctuated and on a few occasions were normal.</p><p>Over the following 12 yr, the patient continued to present with recurrent sinopulmonary infections. A wheeze often accompanied chest symptoms, and she was started on steroid inhalers after a diagnosis of asthma was established. Recurrent otitis externa and otitis media eventually became chronic and were associated with scarring of the tympanic membrane. She also had two admissions with cellulitis requiring i.v. antibiotics. It was noted that with episodes of infection, although she felt systemically unwell, with nausea and vomiting, a recordable fever was observed on only two occasions, throughout multiple inpatient admissions for systemic infection. In addition, neutrophil response was blunted, and she did not generate a CRP increase. Response to antibiotics tended to be slow or absent. However, throughout this time she was found to be thriving and missed very little school.</p><p>At the age of 11, she developed a severe pneumonia that was complicated by a pleural effusion. Cultures from blood and pleural fluid grew fully sensitive <italic>S. aureus</italic>; however, the pleural fluid aspirated was notably lacking pus. Around this time, she also began to develop occasional skin spots and skin-colored nontender subcutaneous nodules, which were associated with dermatitis and intense pruritus. Persistent scratching led to the development of deeply excoriated craters on thighs, buttocks, scalp, arms, and shoulders. Histology obtained from biopsy of an eczematous lesion on the buttock excluded vasculitis, granulomatous disease, or pemphigoid but revealed an underlying eosinophil-rich inflammatory dermatosis, severe enough to extend into the subcutaneous fat, with flame figure formation. However, a definitive histopathological diagnosis could not be established. Skin and nasal swabs routinely grew <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which was usually fully sensitive, although methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> was grown on several occasions. She has had multiple admissions with cellulitis requiring i.v. antibiotics since childhood. She also had occasional episodes of moderate, transient oral and vaginal candida, which occurred in association with antibiotic treatment; however, she has never had disseminated or invasive <italic>Candida</italic> infection.</p><p>Repeated attempts at prophylaxis with numerous antibiotics were unsuccessful, although patient adherence may have been unsatisfactory. Staphylococcal eradication therapy also failed. She transitioned to adult care, but thereafter she was lost to follow up between the ages of 18 and 26 yr.</p><p>She represented to immunology at the age of 26 yr, at which point all her immunological tests were repeated. Notable abnormal results were significantly elevated IgE, eosinophilia, absent mannose-binding lectin, and high levels of baseline IL-6 (830.8 pg/ml and 205.6 pg/ml on two samples; normal range, 0&#x2013;7 pg/ml).</p><p>Further respiratory tract infections since representation have been associated with growth of <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. She has had one episode of peripherally inserted central catheter line&#x2013;associated sepsis, with <italic>S. aureus</italic> grown from blood cultures and <italic>Proteus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultured from the line tip. Skin lesions persisted and included deep excoriations, subcutaneous nodules, and eczema, with pruritus as a predominant symptom. In adulthood, she has had recurrent admissions several times a year with painful swelling of her left leg, shoulder, arm, and hand. Subcutaneous and perifascial edema without collections are usually seen in the limbs. Aspiration of the shoulder collection has been attempted, but never successfully. More recently, she presented with recurrent mastitis and a lump in the left breast, which was felt to be an abscess with associated ductal disease; on the penultimate episode, 8 ml of pus growing <italic>S. aureus</italic> was aspirated from an abscess inferior to the left lateral malleolus, showing that pus formation is not completely absent. The most recent episode was of severe cellulitis of the entire left leg, with pain, erythema, marked swelling, and edema involving the subcutis down to and including the fascial plane on magnetic resonance imaging, showing that erythema is not completely absent; however, the patient remained apyrexial with undetectable CRP throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s07"><title>Clinical studies</title><p>The NBR-RD study was established in the UK to further the clinical management of patients with rare diseases by providing a national resource of WGS data.

Illumina performed the alignment to GRCh37 genome build and calling of variants &lt;50 bp in length using Isaac software, while large deletions were called with Manta and Canvas algorithms. The WGS data files were received at the University of Cambridge High Performance Computing Service for further in-house quality control and processing. The analyses presented here are based on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels (&lt;50 bp long) with overall pass rate (OPR) &gt;0.98 across 13,037 in-house NBR-RD genomes, and high-confidence deletion calls. Variants were annotated with Sequence Ontology terms according to their predicted consequences; their frequencies in other genomic databases (gnomAD, UK10K, 1000 Genomes), if they have been associated with a disease according to the Human Gene Mutation Database Pro database; and internal metrics (allele number, allele count, allele frequency [AF], and OPR).</p><p>For assessment of ancestry, relatedness, and loss of heterozygosity, a set of reliably genotyped, unlinked SNVs were chosen as follows: 292,878 autosomal SNVs typed by three widely used Illumina genotyping arrays were filtered to exclude those with at least one missing genotype in the NBR-RD 13,037 genomes or OPR &lt;0.99; more than two alleles in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 or NBR-RD datasets; and minor AF (MAF) &lt;0.3 in NBR-RD. Finally, after pruning with PLINK so that all pairs of SNVs had r<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.2, we were left with 32,875 SNVs to be used for further analyses. Ancestry relative to 1000 Genomes populations was estimated by performing principal component analysis. PC-Relate R package and the same set of SNVs were used to generate overall proportion of genome-wide homozygosity, as well as pairwise kinship coefficients that allowed us to compute a maximal unrelated sample set for the purposes of internal AF estimation. A denser set of SNVs (all with OPR &gt;0.98 and internal AF &gt;0.5%) and bcftools roh tool were used to compute the exact regions displaying loss of heterozygosity, which were found to span the entire C1 and account for the total homozygosity in this sample.

To call SNVs and deletion-insertion variants, UnifiedGenotyper and Genome Analysis Toolkit Variant quality score recalibration was performed as described previously with minor modifications. Generated lists of SNVs and deletion-insertion variants were annotated with SNPEFF. Variants present in 1000 Genomes Project and/or gnomAD datasets with MAF &#x2265;0.01 were excluded from further analyses. An internal database of &gt;2,000 exomes was also used to filter out recurrent variants.

The enrollment for one pilot study was coordinated by the NIHR BioResource (preprint from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/507244">https://doi.org/10.1101/507244</ext-link>) and the other by Genomics England Limited, a wholly owned company of the Department of Health in the UK. More than 90% of participants in the pilot studies have been enrolled in the NIHR BioResource. These pilot studies were mainly funded by grants from the NIHR in England to the University of Cambridge and Genomics England Limited, respectively. Additional funding was provided by the British Heart Foundation, Medical Research Council, NHS England, and the Wellcome Trust, among many other funders. The pilot studies use data provided by patients and their close relatives and collected by the NHS and other healthcare providers as part of their care and support.</p>
